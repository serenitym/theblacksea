Eversince I was a kid, lying on the beach, I was dying to find out what was happening on the other side of the sea. Years have passed, and in the meantime I have worked as a photographer for various Romanian newspapers and magazines. I am a freelancer since 5 years now, and it is not necessarily that I want this, but I work for the international mass-media more often than for the local media. A list of the recent publications can be seen right here. I am supported in finding clients for photos by the following agencies: <a href=\'http://www.panos.co.uk/\' target=\'_blank\'>Panos Pictures</a>, <a href=\'http://globalassignment.gettyimages.com/#find-a-photographer\' target=\'_blank\'>Getty Images</a>, <a href=\'http://www.shoottheearth.com/\' target=\'_blank\'>Shoot the Earth</a>. I have earned several photography awards, I’ve had numerous group exhibitions – in June 2010 I am exhibiting my photos in Germany, within the <a href=\'http://www.fotofestival-hannover.de/ausstellungen.html?&L=1\' target=\'_blank\'>Lumix Festival for Young Photojournalism</a>.

The latter is an old, Russian town, organized on a regular grid, a former fort which was turned into a touristic resort in the days of Tsarist Russia. There is a very interesting blend of 19th-century buildings, Stalinist constructions and classic Communist apartment blocks in an exuberant scenery of sub-tropical vegetation. The oldest buildings on the bank side have been renovated, but most of the Sukhumi facades have been riddled with bullets. Hills covered by cypresses, palm trees, sycamores and lianas flow right into the sea. The gravelled beach is very narrow and stretches along the entire city, on the left and the right of the harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">The modern part of Sukhumi is a neighborhood of tall and crammed buildings; this was the most severely damaged area in the Georgian-Abkhazi conflict. It is situated next to the Gumuri River which marks both the city outskirts in the north and the initial border line between the Abkhazi and the Georgian forces. Many apartments are empty and have no windows; the doors, however, are all locked. Almost every building has a memorial plate bearing the names of the tenants that lost their life in the conflict.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"fullImage\" src=\"http://local.blacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article1/011.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 520px;\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Anaid is a journalist who works for one of the two weekly independent journals of Abkhazia. The journal she works for has four pages, only 1.000 copies are printed and lives of advertising. The editorial team &ndash; with the exception of Anaid &ndash; includes an occasional collaborator and the editor-in-chief. There are no other newspapers or magazines, mainly because there are only two printing presses. Until last year, all the newspapers of Abkhazia were printed at a single print press. On the eve of the presidential elections, the printing press was shut down. The two independent journals then began to be published on the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://era-abkhazia.org/news/smi/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">internet</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">&nbsp;in a PDF format. Not even the post office works in Abkhazia, a thing we learned for ourselves. One can send a postcard only from the post office in Sukhumi; the clerks there told us that all the letters are sent to Sochi, Russia where they are sorted and sent to the respective addresses.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Anaid says there is no subject she can&rsquo;t tackle, but, at the same time, there is no access to any sort of information. Not even the journalists working for government journals have access to information regarding the shareholders of companies or details regarding certain contracts, despite the legislation which regularizes access to information. Anaid&rsquo;s paper wanted to investigate the case of the only bank in Gagra, a touristic resort on the border with Russia, which was said to be owned by the son of the governor of the National Bank. They sued the National Bank for not providing the information, they won two trials, they wrote about the case, but it was all in vain. They were, however, sued for slander by the National Bank and lost.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://local.blacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article1/01.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 520px;\" /></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Although Anaid&rsquo;s general attitude towards the government is rather critical, her opinion on the relations with Georgia runs along the same lines. She doesn&rsquo;t travel to Georgia because she fears for her life. Moreover, she is a public figure and, therefore, needs a special pass from the government in order to cross the border. She believes she would get into trouble with the secret services and her visit would be perceived as a pact with the enemy and she would suffer great image problems.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Far from being enveloped in a typical war zone atmosphere, Sukhumi is a buoyant and colourful town. &nbsp;A great segment of the beach south of the harbour is part of the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Sukhumi Sanatorium</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">, a complex owned by a Moscow army regiment. After paying a fee, one can gain access through a military check point. At the gate, we&rsquo;re greeted by Lenin&rsquo;s mosaic portrait, flanked by palm trees. Tens of pavilions and two high-rise buildings are occupied by Russian officers who have come on vacation with their family and are guarded by several tanks covered with the camouflage netting. The terraces on the bank side provide the fun part for the tenants.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://local.blacksea.eu/RES/uploads/images/article1/031.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 520px;\" /></span></p>','<p>Once we reach Sukhumi, we quickly deal with the visa formalities. After presenting the invitation issued by the Abkhazi authorities and paying the visa fee at a downtown bank, we go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where in ten minutes&rsquo; time we are issued a visa printed on a separate sheet of paper, just like in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/yerevan-%E2%80%93-stepanakert-nkr-585\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. As in the NKR, passing through Abkhazia leaves no trace in one&rsquo;s passport, but the visa has to be shown when leaving Abkhazia.</p>','One dedication after the other and the dancers become ecstatic.','Abkhazia','Sukhum'),(10,101,1,'2012-11-20','2012-12-01',NULL,NULL,'redirect calatorii','<p>\r\n	Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.Continut despre articolul despre calatriii.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n','Lead despre acest articol de calatorii.Rescris',NULL,NULL,NULL),(13,102,1,'2012-11-22',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit.','<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>\r\n	Aenean tristique, magna nec laoreet auctor, elit ipsum mollis tellus, nec venenatis leo ipsum non justo.

However, the most important thing is that not once did we pay anything to the road police, the customs officers or the border guards (except in Transnistria where, out of 10 verifications in a day and a half, we gave in to one and paid a 20-dollar ticket for a fabrication).</p>\r\n	        <p>After returning home, people kept asking me about differences and similarities with Romania.

Even Turkey in relation to the issue of the Kurds. Colleagues my age studied in improvised schools, in bunkers and have lost friends and family in such conflicts; their parents and grandparents were arrested, deported or executed. The region is similar to the Balkans’ situation of the ‘90s, but at a much larger scale and with conflicts spanning over the past hundred years, with abuses and events of an unthinkable cruelty. The international community has had absolutely no firm reaction whatsoever, much less an efficient strategy to mend things.</p>\r\n	        <p>An important similarity would be the general virulent tone against primitive politicians. The simple folks I talked to, no matter their country or religion, expressed their utter disgust against their own politicians and the belief that foreigners see them as barbaric only because of the latter’s politicians and leaders.

It’s funny to see so much surety and passion in those foreign to the region. The correct spelling of a town’s name is highly disputed even by the locals themselves. Only for Sukhumi there are 30 variations in spelling, each similar to a political statement recognizing an interpretation of the town’s history. My objective wasn’t to write a diploma paper on changes in town names, so I decided to transliterate from Russian one of the ways the name is written on the entry plates into town or to use the name on the English map. As regards comments about words ‘which do not exist in Romanian’, I can only say that, fortunately, the Romanian tongue is very dynamic – otherwise, I would have had to express myself via countless combinations of cheese, cabbage, badger and colt.</p>\r\n        ',NULL,NULL,NULL),(18,85,1,'2012-12-14','2012-12-30',NULL,NULL,'a doua prioritate','<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, quot utamur intellegat eu eum.

The fishing nets lay nicely piled up in the sun, the barracks, where the fish was unloaded, looked spick and span and the fishermen were sipping tea after tea gazing into the distance. There was a sea storm and the weather didn&rsquo;t seem to improve sooner than three, four days. Cheerful and eager to chat, they pulled their chairs around us and started to ask us about our life, clinging on to their boss, the only speaker of English in the entire harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"fullwidth space\" src=\"/RES/uploads/foto/blogpost2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we mentioned Romania, I was positive their faces would light up and they&rsquo;d nod their heads in delight: &lsquo;Hagi, Hagi. Lucescu.&rsquo; Well, I was about to have the biggest surprise of my life. They started to grin to one another and exchange cheerful glances. Some of them got to their feet and held out their wrists joined together. &lsquo;Virtually everybody here has spent a few days in the Romanian prisons for poaching&rsquo;, their boss translates and adds that his own brother got some time in the Romanian nick last spring. The time spent there doesn&rsquo;t seem to have had any traumatizing effect on any of them; actually, judging by their grinning faces and the warm, puckish looks thrown our way (as if to their younger, dumb friends who got screwed over), they see it as a very successful prank. And they did get screwed over, because, while their Bulgarian and Romanian neighbours are fighting at the European Commission for dividing the brill fishing quotas, they poach it like crazy and sell it on the black market in Istanbul for 30-40 Euros/kg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst that morning&rsquo;s peacefulness and the general giggle, a firm and vigorous &lsquo;cock-a-doodle-doo&rsquo; rose above it all, triggering an explosion of exhilaration among the fishermen. Their boss plucked our sleeves and invited us into his floor-tiled office (with a heap of registers on his desk) where an old man was knotting some fishing nets and on a cupboard a white, red-combed rooster reigned. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s our clock&rsquo; he says, at which the fishermen burst out laughing.</p>','<p>I&rsquo;ve always wondered what the poachers on the Turkish fishing vessels displaying random flags and being summoned with hundreds of gunshots by the Romanian border police look like. Judging by the news in Romania, the scenario is always the same. The Turkish poachers swaggeringly wave the Ukrainian or Romanian flag hoping to pass unnoticed, the Romanian frontier policemen &lsquo;pick up their scent&rsquo; and summon them by machine guns until they surrender themselves, but not before throwing overboard most of the game. In the end, everybody goes home, except for the captains who get to be investigated.</p>','Some Sec Lead about turcia','Turkey','Oras turc'),(20,88,3,'2013-07-09','2013-07-10',NULL,NULL,'Lipovan villages of Dobruja','<p>The atmosphere of Lipovan villages is best defined by order and cleanliness. Not that big of a deal. It&rsquo;s something natural; however, when your eyes are used to fences with missing planks, yards decorated with broken tyres, broken refrigerators, sofas with busted springs, seeing tidy yards, laundry laid out on ropes to dry and piles of wood neatly stacked feels like waking up from one heavy, depressing slumber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second we entered Jurilovca, an infusion of colours invigorated us. From one end to the other, the village is replete with small, delicate, mild, neat and wonderfully preserved flowers. A good farmer <em>does</em> make a good farm, we thought. And went on thinking it for the few days spent there, as the people of Jurilovca opened up to us, opened their yards, proof that everybody got up early in the morning... Jurilovca came as a surprise to us. Located at the edge of the sea, towards, Gura Porti?ei, we had expected to find a village under the rule of real estate developers, smothered by pensions with stainless steel balcony railing and pontoons for speedboats. We were deeply wrong. Jurilovca proved to be a traditional, honest village with the type of community that go about their business even when tourists come by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We met C?t?lin at the fishery. We were walking among the boats lifted on stilts waiting to get either painted or welded here and there where the joints had cracked and we could smell the tar used to oil the fishermen&rsquo;s wooden boats. The little harbor was humming with life, the atmosphere was great; it almost looked like a place frozen in time, a place where engineers wore caps and blue overalls, where they smoked at the lathe and the workday ended at four. Did Jurilovca experience the revolution or not? It did as the channel hasn&rsquo;t been cleared since then, so navigation has been restricted to small fishermen&rsquo;s boats. It did experience the revolution because poaching and abusive leasing has halved the number of the village fishermen. Otherwise, in the background, a radio was playing Romanian music, though the signal got weaker and weaker at times, and the people working at the shops had that relaxed mien of the &lsquo;80s. Somehow they had nothing to lose and nothing to gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C?t?lin Balaban was our ticket into the community of Lipovan fishermen, the vote of confidence that we were alright and had come in peace. C?t?lin is the head of one of the fishermen&rsquo;s associations in Jurilovca and we were guided towards him as he was the authority to whom we had to request permission to take pictures. We went to him terror-stricken. In 90 % of the scenarios imagined we would be asked to leave the private property. The opposite happened. Not only did we receive permission to do whatever we wanted, but he took it as a personal challenge: opening the door to the most authentic scrap of the daily life of Lipovans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"520\" id=\"img_10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/foto/102.jpg\" width=\"850\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, at six a.m. the next day we were in Victor&rsquo;s boat advancing quietly on Lake Razelm as if through a photo wallpaper of fishermen&rsquo;s figures hidden in the reed and a sky of such intense pink hues as only Photoshop could achieve (or so I thought). I will tell you more about Victor in the next post dedicated exclusively to the fishermen on Lake Razelm. However, this image is burnt into my brain: tens of fishermen screaming and hysterically spinning around our boat while Victor was striving to pull the wire nets where the fish had been caught. Victor would remove the dead ones and throw them to the sea gulls: &lsquo;These are my hens. I feed them every morning&rsquo;, he said laughing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"520\" id=\"img_3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/foto/37.jpg\" width=\"850\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 12 p.m. we had reached the shore, feeling the ground floating under our feet and a net (we couldn&rsquo;t refuse) in our hands. The net contained the following: zander, carp, catfish, pickerel and bream. We hardly snapped out of it that C?t?lin took charge of us and said: &lsquo;Now you are gonna see what fish borsch really tastes like&rsquo;. And so we did. A delicious borsch prepared by Hari and his wife on a warm autumn afternoon under their vine arbour. After having removed the scales in a couple of minutes, Hari told us that: &lsquo;The secret is to let the water cover the fish completely. Listen to me. Fish borsch is one of the few things that really matter in life. It was what brought me back home.&rsquo;</p>','<p>The Romanian villages of Dobruja left me with a taste of dust and a feeling of human despair, with barefoot children raised by whoever can, people staring vacantly through cheap alcohol vapours in a fatalistic indifference to the poverty which came upon them like a curse.

Your car is already there</p>\r\n<p>I’ve heard this joke in various Western countries, repeated in the same way, referring to each and every country in the East. This is just the beginning. In Romania you need to avoid stray dogs. They have rabies and attack people’s neck (and in Harghita, you may die of starvation if you don’t know Hungarian!) In Bulgaria, there are criminals disguised as policemen everywhere you go. And your car is going to be stolen anyway. Turks don’t wash themselves, they are such stinking people! Stay away from Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – there is war in there! In the Caucasian Republics there are only Mujahideens and KGB agents, who slaughter each other. I didn’t hear anything about Crimea, and Odessa is the headquarter of the Russian mafia. In Transdniester, it looks like there are no normal people – even the weather is always gloomy. About Moldavians, what’s left to be said, Russians are not at fault, you know! I heard some mafiosi place themselves in the middle of the road, play dead and when you try to help them, they put their pistol next to your temple and rob you.</p>\r\n<p>Not only the foreigners in the region use such clichés. 6 tears ago, my car caught fire on the road that connects Urziceni and Buz?u, a perfectly flat, extremely circulated road in middle of the field. I stopped on the right side of the road, I didn’t have an extinguisher. From underneath the hood, flames and a gross smoke came forth. The only car that stopped was a Ukrainian van: a whole family of Ukrainians. They moved really fast and stopped the fire in just one minute, with their drinking water. The Romanians must have thought I was a much too evident trap. And the Ukrainians were probably KGB agents.</p>\r\n<p>We are afraid of each other. And we are extremely afraid of foreigners, even if they live few kilometers beyond the boundary.</p>\r\n<p>I’ve made various long term trips for journalistic purposes close to and far away from the country. Before the trip, warnings used to flow. If we had taken them for granted, we wouldn’t have spent not even one day of research along the <a href=\"http://old.crji.org/arhiva/031202.htm\">border with Moldova and Ukraine</a>. Not even two weeks in <a href=\"http://old.crji.org/arhiva/031202.htm\">Transnistria</a> or three months in India, Bolivia or Kenya, neither any other short of incursions to exotic places.</p>\r\n<p>We will travel around the Black Sea and we discover we are not alone. Some French journalists are making the same tour on water, on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://venisemernoire.org/\">a boat</a></span>. A Basque journalist is a restless <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.hiddeneurope.co.uk/hidden-europe-author-karlos-zurutuza\">photographer in the Caucasian Republic</a>s</span>. Someone organizes <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://blacksearun.com/\">a car race around the sea</a></span>. These are personal projects. Unfortunately, the main feature of the media within the region is provincialism –so, the press doesn’t invest in such things. The reports about this area are made by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.laengengrad24.de/\">Western journalists</a></span>. The local ones are sent, on the same expense, to trample each other for two days, together with some other hundreds of journalists, when a Haiti earthquake takes place. This happens when international topics find their way by force into the news, bursting in upon the Senior Editors.</p>\r\n<p>When they don’t perpetuate clichés, the foreign journalist’s approach has amazing results. Maybe also because he has a fresh eye and is not blasé. A <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Black-Sea-Neal-Ascherson/dp/0809015935/ref=cm_cr_rdp_orig_subj\">British journalist</a></span> wrote a book about this region that continues to be complete and up to date even after 20 years. We are trying to have a similar approach: four fresh eyes, some digital technique, Turkish and Russian dictionaries and much curiosity – in a feat of strength of three months. We want to find out about the mixture of peoples and about diversity and we have the advantage of belonging here. It will be an exciting blind search.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the whole region, civilization is a concept that begins from the West side of each interviewed person. Eastwards, the barbarians are always swarming. And any of us is regarded as a barbarian when traveling in the West. We, the people around the Black  Sea, are isolated peoples, a mixture of totalitarian regimes and young democracies. Some of them are still involved into continuous conflicts, suffocated by pessimism or by an overflowing optimism. We shall take a bath of civilization and barbarism, at the very source.</p>\r\n<p>From here on, you will read and watch a blog about a journalistic trip.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(353,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-24',NULL,NULL,'Tuzla, Romania – Tsarevo, Bulgaria (400 km)','<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-352\" title=\"_DSC6179\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/DSC6179.jpg\" alt=\"Tsarevo, Bulgaria\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first posts are going to be as hectic as we were before the departure*. The visas for Russia and that for Azerbaijan in particular made a hash of our arrangements but, at last, over a week late, we hit the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following days are going to be more of a race to Ankara, where I and Petru? are going to leave in turn, for three days, for jobs planned long before we had known the exact date of the Black Sea tour. We will be returning to this area, so these first few days will be a sort of a recon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While leaving Vama, I notice a cluster of little houses for low-budget tourists set against the cemetery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first stop is at Krapets, 24 km from Vama, a fishermen’s village chockfull of vegetable gardens. We make our way to the fishermen’s bay where Petre, an old bushy-eyebrowed man, is striving to repair a fisherman’s boat, a fisherman who must go out to sea with the local divers. His boat can be seen somewhere in the distance and Petre says it’s rented by the local divers looking for seashells. Petre speaks Romanian very well, he’s got relatives along the coast and the Delta. When hearing about our destination, he garrulously tells us a joke about a ‘German’ who goes to Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey where he eats and drink at his leisure. The next day, in Romania, he gets a stomach ache, in Bulgaria his head hurts and in Turkey – Petre starts to move frantically, making large gestures pointing towards his behind. In a worried voice, he tells us to be careful as Turks do not joke about. We ask him if he has ever been to Turkey. Negative answer. The reason? Gas costs double the amount (well, a piece of information which proves to be false).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the main road, besides impressive aeolian parks, clusters of brand new constructions come into sight. At almost 90 km from Vama, we encounter a huge brand-new complex set on a plateau above the sea. Inside – a spacious golf course guarded by a row of villas like peas in a pod. A German construction to the core, with every little detail well-rounded. A single player is present on the golf course. I felt we were dealing with a luxury complex – though the prices posted on the site seem moderate (<a href=\"http://www.lighthouse-bg.com/\">www.lighthouse-bg.com</a>). Admittedly, a rather artificial setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here on, on the edge of the highway, road signs (written in German) begin to pop up – the language of the tourists who dwell these papier-mâché all-inclusives. As we approach Varna (150 km from Vama) and Burgas (approximately 250 km), the number of tourist complexes increases wildly – we’re talking about a massive and very impressive structure, even if it entails a huge amount of  concrete and an eccentric, American mall-like architecture endowed with turrets. The only villages to have escaped the fury of concrete are those at the ends of the Bulgarian coast, bordering Romania and Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After leaving Burgas, several alternatives come into sight, in small coastal towns where such massive all-inclusive organizations haven’t had the chance to be built. These alternatives come in rows along the road to Sozopol, a road leaving the main highway out of Bulgaria. Starving to death, we decide to grab a bite in Chernomorets. There’s no activity in this little town before high season; only one restaurant is open – so we fall into our first tourist trap (at least for me, its consequences lasted two whole days). Food may be good and cheap in Bulgaria, but we didn’t luck out the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spend the night in Tsarevo where a straight road takes us to the customs point with Turkey. A calm little town, flanked by two large bays whose locals walk with a lazy gait (I have noticed many of them loitering on terraces, indulging in a spritzer and fresh fish). Tomorrow we enter Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*(For technical reasons – translation and blog maintenance – our posts will be two weeks late as opposed to the real rhythm of the trip)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translated by: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(366,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-25',NULL,NULL,'Tsarevo, Bulgaria – Akcakoca, Turkey (520 km)','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-368\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/1.jpg\" alt=\"Istanbul, december 2009\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-372\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-373\" title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-374\" title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-375\" title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-376\" title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-377\" title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-369\" title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve left very early in the morning, because we’re planning to arrive to the Black Sea coast between Istanbul and Ankara sometime in the afternoon, and because this means crossing Istanbul on the motor highway that cuts the town into two and crosses the Bosphorus. Those who have ever driven in Istanbul at rush hours know this is a more than challenging mission. Not to mention I had woken up with a food intoxication (with fever, headaches – everything) because of the copious dinner the previous day. Some friends had recommended us to eat in Sinemorets and we had confounded it with Chernomorets (Thanks, Dan, we try it next time!) So, I am carrying this illness on my feet, or pedals…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We depart from Tsarevo towards Malko Tarnovo – a road of about 65 km, passing through a fir forest. It’s a free road, we hardly meet anybody till we get to the border. And here we are, leaving Bulgaria without having been robbed. The car is intact, no false policeman has stopped us. We’ve even been impressed by the existing infrastructure along the coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entering Turkey is fast and costless. We don’t pay taxes, nobody controls our car. Speed limitation is frustrating on a plain road, without any car to occupy it. We’ve been warned radars may burn holes in people’s pocket, so we drive extremely carefully. And good for us: on the right side, a police car that has stopped four English motor-cyclists comes into sight. Lots of papers are being filled in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have paid the tax of 35 liras (1.8 liras against one euro) for the motor highway from the border with Bulgaria to Ankara. Three bands on each way, gas stations with wifi for free – the only thing missing was a decent coffee. Anywhere you ask for a coffee you get an instant ness weakened with too much water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having approached Istanbul and crossed the bridge over the Bosphorus gave me the necessary amount of adrenaline to overcome any kind of fever or headache. Just imagine thousands of trucks, buses, big and small cars and motor bicycles, all of them crowding to go beyond the bars at the tax payment point of the frontier. They all want to enter at once, if possible. The distance at the border of avoiding any emergency has changed into the distance at the border of avoiding any violent contact. It seems like the whole carpark of a hypermarket is moving in one direction with the cars almost touching each other, trying to pass beyond the bars and to flow as if through a funnel. It is a real spectacle even for the local people, who sit down for a picnic on the margins of the motor highway, watching TV, alone or in groups. Some of them are playing games, others are drinking tea or eating. The klaxon is used only to draw attention, never aggressively. Then, the multitude of cars passes beyond the bars and rearranges on a few columns. No one is blocking anyone – otherwise we wouldn’t be able to move. The chaos covers more than 30 km – sometimes the cars mass starts driving with 90 km/hour, until we get beyond the bridge over the Bosphorus and beyond the payment bar for the Ankara motor highway. The landscape we’re crossing is a concentration of hard industry and unending platforms with blocks of flats, coming one after another nearby the sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We leave the motor highway to Hendek and withdraw over night on the Black Sea coast. We are running on a road that is ideal for bicycles, 50 km of hills. From the distance, all of them look as if covered with grapery. Wrong. We are in the heart of a region that is famous for its massive production of hazel nuts. We go out bemused with having seen so many hazel nuts and enter Kocaali, a little harbor town, with an agitated centre, somewhere up the hills, closer to the hazel nuts hills than to the beach. It’s not the season yet and we don’t find anything for accommodation, so we drive along the coast towards the East. We stop in Ackakoca, an elegant small town, bigger than the previous. We find a hotel 50 meters from the sea, we get a room at the first floor, with a huge balcony, from where we can see the whole bay. Petru? makes a salad I am looking with eager longing at. My stomach is gasping in a threatening way. We are almost 1000 km away from Romania and I am watching the first sunset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*The pictures were not shot on this occasion, but on a documentary trip made last year in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/Engleza - CV Ruxandra Munteanu.doc\">Translated by: Ruxandra Munteanu</a></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(386,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-26',NULL,NULL,'Akçakoca – Ankara (320 km) ','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/11.jpg\" alt=\"Alaplibolucheck, Turkey\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-384\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-385\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coffee has become an issue. The locals are avid tea drinkers, so everywhere we go, we’re offered only very weak instant coffee. Seldom does one find Turkish coffee – which comes in small quantities and is expensive. So we’ve decided to fit ourselves with a Turkish kettle. Which we’re going to put to very good use in gas stations and hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This morning we set out for Ankara along the coast on an embanked roadway fifteen metres from the sea. An extraordinary view for us – for the locals, a technical road for transporting cargo. Of no interest whatsoever for tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike yesterday’s rush, we can finally stop here and there, geography also giving us a helping hand. From Alapl? we immerse ourselves into the hills once more. You thought Romanians were hospitable?! Hmm, wait till you see the Turks. The first village we stop in we’re mistaken for Russians and welcomed by the village elders, a big smile on their faces. Higher up in the mountains, on a logging site from Adana, the sawyers call out to a colleague who can speak a bit of Romanian and he explains to the others who we are and where we’re headed. A little lower, an old man and his wife are taking a lunch break on the edge of a plot of land where they had planted potatoes and beans. We’re offered tea and invited to join them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reach Y???lca near the highway and, for a while, we drive parallel to it. Then we enter the straight road to Ankara. Yesterday’s chaos is history. Except for us, not a soul on the highway. Up in the sky, two fighter planes are doing somersaults, chasing each other in circles. We stop for coffee at a diner with a parking lot. I put the water to boil in the restaurant; nobody minds it. We sit on the restaurant terrace and eat the home-made cake we bought along. In front of the restaurant, a worker is keeping himself busy with a hose near our car. I think out loud: ‘With so much free stuff, it would be something to have our car washed on the house.’ And whad’ya know, that’s exactly what the Turk does. A large grin on his face, the man grabs hose and brush and starts to wash the car. We instantly think we might have fallen into some tourist trap, so I go to thank him and give him three liras. The washing lasts ten more minutes and then, the same grin on his face, the Turk opens the doors, closes them one by one and, with a rag, keeps rubbing the car that has slowly set itself into motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translated by: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(392,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-27',NULL,NULL,'Ankara (1230 km)','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/12.jpg\" alt=\"New Ankara\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-389\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-390\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-391\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday we entered Ankara. Although the GPS we’re using (Garmin nuvi) doesn’t have the map of Turkey, it does have a general support for the main roads. The car keeps positioning itself parallel to the road, but an approximate direction is somewhat useful outside cities. Once we enter the city, the gadget becomes useless, so the only sense of direction we get is from signalling systems. Which gets us off the track in the first five minutes. We reach a platform of blocks of flats, one of the many we have seen ever since our arrival in Turkey. Up close, nothing seems spectacular anymore: blocks of fifteen storeys and even taller ones with big spaces between them, parking lots and playgrounds. And yet, life on such a platform must be ghastly because of the distance from the city. I have read an interview about two young women who lived on a similar platform near Istanbul – they needed seven hours to go to work and return home every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We regained our sense of direction thanks to the locals and headed for the city centre. We got swamped into a chaos similar to the one when crossing Istanbul. Police cars and ambulances do not have right of way. However, we granted a police car, its rotating light on, right of way – the policeman cast a surprised glance at me and very cautiously drove ahead, as if expecting to get ambushed. After two hours in chaotic traffic, we decide to find a paid parking lot and we head off on foot through the town centre – K?z?lay (New Ankara). For a couple of hours, we went in search for cheap hotels – until we found the ideal offer. In the evening we learned that it was one of Lonely Planet’s top recommendations (we had decided to avoid the guidebook recommendations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Ankara. The town centre is a coloured and noisy mixture of stalls with clothes, paintings, restaurants and superposed terraces. It doesn’t have the air of a tourist attraction, but it is definitely a sight for the locals. Around us, a multitude of youngsters, but no foreign tourists whatsoever. Moreover, no visible signs of religious strictness. We find two streets decorated for Christmas, heavy with wreaths and suspended Christmas lights. Instead of Christmas symbols, overhead we see the logo of Efes Pilsener beer. Most terraces are populated by men. Only in a few places do young women and men drink together and these are rock bar terraces. Otherwise, Tarkan’s music fills the streets, and the blokes maddeningly whistle tunes and clap their hands every evening, no matter if the next day is a work day or the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translated by: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(400,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-28',NULL,NULL,'Old Ankara','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-401\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-402\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-403\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-404\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I was out, Petrut wandered around the old part of Ankara. During lunch, a pitchman told him many interesting stories. In Turkish. He found some pigeon lovers who offered him a cup of tea, silently agreed to be photographed and then continued to watch the pigeons through their binoculars. He watched the unstrained relationship between the clothes salesmen and the tailor’s dummies standing in the threshold of their store. A salesman caresses the heads of his identical children, dressed as princes. Another salesman holds his tailor’s dummy dressed in a pink, downy bathrobe. After resting for a while, one by one the salesmen take a few steps towards the middle of the road and begin to praise their merchandise in a loud voice. Then they return in front of their shop windows just as determined, pour themselves a cup of tea and return to their place in the middle of their family, among the dummies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ankara is comprised of the new, central part of the city (Kizalay) and several hills surrounding it. Two kilometers north of Kizalay we got to Ulus, the old center of the city, where the souq begins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old Ankara seems to enjoy less the presence of tourists than the new Ankara. During our prolonged walk, we counted exactly three tourists. The old Ankara is a labyrinth of narrow streets, compact houses and improvised parts of the souq, disposed in a bold dip. The architecture is of medieval inspiration, yet the goods displayed on the stands catch the eye with their lights, tinsels and colorful plastic. On the other side you can find bulk coal, all kinds of left-overs and iron-made things, the cheapest haircut and piles of all sorts and colours of meat. It seems to be the shopping area ot the townspeople and resembles the old center of Bucharest of the ‘90s. In the gangway between the carpets, the price of the hotel room is of around 10 Euros per night (you may also rent it by hour).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more „touristic” stalls stand towards the edge of the hill, near a museum-fortified citadel and the view over the city (<a href=\"http://www.ankarakalesi.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7&amp;Itemid=12\" target=\"_blank\">Ankara Kalesi</a> – around 1000m high).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Translated by: </a></strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Roxana Bocicai</a></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(410,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-05-31',NULL,NULL,'Gecekondu','<p><img title=\"_DSC6357\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/05/DSC6357.jpg\" alt=\"Gecekondu, Old Ankara\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We passed off the fortress above the old center, in order to leave the crowded area by choosing another part of the hill than the souq. We walked randomly in the streets which became even narrower and bold, followed by children who were trying to tell us that the fortress is in the opposite direction. They thought we got lost, because there was nothing of touristic value to be seen there. Every now and then, somebody was showing us by weaving their hands to return and that the road was a dead end. We arrived in the middle of some Turkish favelas, compacted boldly on the flank of the hill.

In Romanian, the word means „suburb”, but it bears the meaning of „built overnight”. This is because all the houses were built illegally, some 30-40 years ago. Some say that, back then, a juridical inadvertence granted one the right not to be demolished, provided that one began to build their house after the nightfall and finish the construction before the break of dawn, without the knowledge of the authorities. This kind of buildings (considered squatters) began to gain popularity in Istanbul and Ankara, due to the massive migration from the countryside to big cities. The construction method even began to be exported – I saw it in Berlin, to a Turk from Kreuzberg, who set up illegally, in the ‘80s, a vegetable garden, in the area of the wall between the East and the West. After the fall of the Berlin wall, he built a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/melita/40222065/page2/\">house</a> using  reused materials. The authorities didn’t succeed in tearing down the house yet).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one of the backfall streets, a householder surrounded by a group of children tries to push uphill an old Renault (our Dacia break). He waved us to help him, so for more than five minutes we pushed the car, accompanied by the children’s shouting. Behind the steering wheel stood the smallest of children, so we climbed in a zigzag manner, which almost crushed the old men standing by the narrow road. The child, whose head could hardly be seen from behind the steering wheel, was frantically turning the steering wheel to one side only, until his father and the old men by the road began to shout. He changed the direction just as determined but then resumed the zigzag. The car stood still in the middle of the road and the father thanked us, his hand over his heart, and mentioned the name of Allah. I couldn’t understand if it was an exercise or a game for his offsprings and we began to walk down the hill, somewhat bandy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The houses are very small, some of them even carved in stone. We entered a house that was nearly a ruin - a quarter of the main room looked like a cave, providing an outright access to a portion of rock apparently too solid to be removed. Many of the houses around seemed deserted, on the verge of being demolished. On the surrounding hills the land appeared to be thoroughly grubed. The Turkish government massively demolished this kind of houses, in order to allow the construction of private buildings – the apartment houses we saw ever since we got near Istanbul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Translated by: </a></strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Roxana Bocicai</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(415,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-01',NULL,NULL,'Çinçin – gangsta city','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-413\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-414\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We crossed two <em>gecekondu</em> hills from the Altindag area. We reached to another hill, surrounded from three parts by the platforms of seemingly new residential compounds. Two of them were enclosed by a solid fence with barbed wire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We later found out that the place is called Çinçin. The women standing at their gates wave at us again to return, but we’re already used to this behaviour. Some of them even make signs warning us to be careful with our camera and kit bags. Many of them insisit that Petrut took them a picture. The streets are calm, crowded with children, it’s almost noon. Every now and then a van passes by with loud music, commercials for watermelons or gas bottles. At the corner of the street, a kite is being lifted – it seems to be a very popular sport. A child talks to us in English, we try to chat for a while, but all he does is to repeat over and over a lesson learnt at school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhere on the hilltop we meet a group of young people – with pretty awkward appearances. Behind us, there is a plump of children whistling and shouting „tourist, tourist”. The young men ask us if we come from Almanya. We answer with Romanya. Their faces  turn suddenly happy and they begin to talk tall: “Roma, roma”. Two of them take care of us, a child with a plastered hand and another child, riding a bike. The group of young men waves at us, smiling toothy, until we disappear from view. The ‘rider’ shows us to a platform-sight and proudly points at the view over the city. He even prompts us to climb a scaffold and take a picture. The child with a plastered hand asks for money, the rider scolds him. He shows us the way out of the neighborhood and we leave the area accompanied by a speech of the rider, in which Allah’s name is frequently mentioned. The boy with the plaster gives another whispered shot: “money, money”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We rush our way down and come across a policemen car, who seem to be having a hard time trying to refrain from laughing when they see us. They say something in Turkish and leave. At the last street corner of this neighborhood, a boy leaves his group of friends to tempt us quite rudely with a speech containing words like „coke” and „heroin”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we got home, we began doing a little research on the area we had just visited. The internet said that Çinçin is considered to be the most dangerous neighborhood of the city. We find texts about “gangsta city”, where highbinders ride in luxury cars, thugs can be met at every street corner, the police uses armoured cars and merchandise vans are secured. This is exaggerated! It doesn’t look like the perfect place for a walk at night or for sightseeing, but things are not so frightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Translated by: </a></strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Roxana Bocicai</a><strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(427,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-01',NULL,NULL,'YouTube, You Who?','<p><img title=\"_DSC6285\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/DSC6285.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p>When we decided to go on this tour, we thought that we might find interesting situations to be filmed on the road, upload them on Youtube and embed them in some posts. Even if we were capable of doing it, we could not access Youtube from Turkey; the access to this site is completely blocked. This situation lasts for several years. Presently, around 3.700 other Internet sites are blocked for Turkish users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The censorship of the Internet for our Turkish neighbours has been a serious problem for more than 10 years. The censored sites posted information against the creator of modern Turkey, Ataturk, insults addressed to the government, or published obscene information or images. The situation is the same for sites containing information regarding minorities, especially those sites related to the Kurds, and also the sites of sexual minorities. (I hope they don’t restrict the access to this blog because of the joke of Petre the fisherman, from Bulgaria!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent report issued by <a href=\" http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-turkey,36675.html\">RSF</a> mentions even a stimulation and an increase in the information related to sites that should be censored: 80.000 in may 2009. If at first sites were blocked by a legal order with no juridical grounds, since 2007 Turkey has an Internet Law: Law no. <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/documents/rfm/2010/01/42294_en.pdf\">5651</a>. YouTube was suspended as a consequence of an enormous scandal between Turkey and Greece – after the Greeks posted some short films containing calumniatory images and information regarding Ataturk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ways to trick these restrictions, by using a proxy, but this facility overloads the traffic and blocks some options. In some cases, owners of the sites rapidly open a mirror of the Internet pages, with a different address. Institutions, NGOs, companies, teachers and journalists from Turkey virulently protested against this decision and even filed a lawsuit at the European Court of Justice to put an end to the censorship. The most vehement objectors requested the withdrawal of the title of European Cultural Capital, granted to the city of Istanbul in 2010 (Milliyet, 17 Februarie 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I walked in the streets of Ankara, in the middle of a national holiday. „Youth and Sports Day” celebrates the begining of the modern Turkey liberation fight and the landing of Ataturk at Samsun in 1919. Ataturk’s effigy, in different stances and sizes, is present everywhere. The scenery reminded me of another landing, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, in Cuba, in 1957. As for the flags and portraits – Havana looks identical .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Translated by: </a></strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Roxana Bocicai</a></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(430,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-03',NULL,NULL,'Leaving Ankara','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-429\" title=\"_DSC6304\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/DSC6304.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pack our bags and leave to Samsun (aproximately 450km East, on the coast).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our hotel is located in a street that used us with more special sounds. Every decent man in the area has at least one grinder, a drill press and a pickhammer that they use on a daily basis, starting at 8 o’clock in the morning and ending late in the evening. We could hear them non-stop on different keys: some low and long, other fearful and short, some others provocative and unexpected. It is a special music. The passage towards the silence of midnight is made through the ripples of the rummy and backgammon pieces. These sounds are representative for this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We found it easy to get over the constant noises. We were very happy to have found a hotel near the center of the city, with large, clean rooms and almost luxurious furniture. But the next day after we checked in, we could hear the first noises in the other rooms. And then we discovered that the water wasn’t running. Some men entered Petrut’s room and worked hard to change some pipes. We had no water the entire day until we left the hotel. We began questioning the hotel managers and their answer was straight to the point: we got a discount.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the third day of scheduled water, they sent us a fruit basket in the room. The receptionist was running out of excuses. They offered us a day for free. Nevertheless: after the water, or the lack thereof, there was a power outage. Shortly after it produced a flame at Petrut’s notebook charger. Old news, it was a reminder of our childhood in a block of flats. We were instinctively searching for some cases for water supplies. We had a flashlight, we only needed candles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Officially, every day is the last day of work. After a week we asked the receptionists if they plan on doing the check-out: all the things from the reception were packed in boxes. I looked at the ceiling and there it was: a gap the size of the Black Sea and the water dripping. Later that evening, Allah listened to our prayers and provided us with water. I heard a clap in the bathroom and from the middle of the ceiling a runnel gleefully began to pour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Translated by: </a></strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engleza_ Roxana Bocicai.doc\">Roxana Bocicai</a></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(444,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-03',NULL,NULL,'Ankara – Trabzon ','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-437\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-438\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-439\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-440\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-441\" title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-442\" title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-443\" title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-445\" title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We leave Ankara and head towards the coast, for Samsun. The landscape is rather arid, with a few interesting canyons where the mountains turn a reddish hue, resembling those in American westerns. After almost 500 km, we start to descend towards the seaside. From afar, the Samsun harbour seems utterly teeming with hustle and bustle – tens of ships await offshore. From here up to the Georgian border, the Turks have built a highway along the coast, a hair’s breadth from the water, spanning over 500 kilometres. There are two and even three lanes, an army of tunnels, some of them many kilometres long. The only segment where the main road leaves the coast is between Fatsa and Ordu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highway cuts off rather ruthlessly the sea from the smaller settlements which have expanded upwards, on hills.  Had there ever been fishermen’s villages on the waterside, nowadays there isn’t the slightest hint of evidence as to that. The villages along the Black Sea stand perched up the hill and mountains, their houses sprawled and built on impossible inclines. On this side of the coast, we have seen almost no trace of beach or tourism. Only after having passed Giresun (home of cherries), do we see traces of organized fishery; near every bigger town fishermen’s bays emerge with downright hookers. And still in Giresun landfills come into sight, right on the water’s edge. In no way does the sea provide for the locals. We quickly figured out why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We thought we had seen enough hazelnuts in Akçakoca. We were deeply wrong. The entire coast is covered by a strip several tens of kilometres in width – hills filled with nut trees dividing the sea from the mountains. I’ve read that hazelnuts produced in the Black Sea region represent 75% of the global production. Following the export, the remaining shells are used for heating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left the main road and delved into the hills packed with nut trees. The villages and towns established near the sea are genuine mountain establishments, full of carpenter and forger’s workshops. The roads become narrower; one single car barely fits on the secondary ones. Graves can be seen in people’s yards – there is the custom for old people to ask (in their will) they be buried in front of their house. Therefore, the house cannot be sold and the children cannot fight over the inheritance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhere near Trabzon, on the waterside, we came across the first grill made with hazelnut shells. Near the road: a colored and bulbs-filled bus now turned into a seafood restaurant. The cook and his wife sleep in a van parked behind the bus. The inside is a miniature imitation of an American restaurant – five small tables with parallel benches, little curtains and other gadgets. Three truck drivers herd together at the only occupied table. One of them, displaying the mien of an intellectual, takes off his eyeglasses and wades in to chat with us. Words in English, Russian, German and Turkish are exchanged. He gives us information regarding the roads and says he likes Bucharest. Hagi’s name inescapably comes up in our conversation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We go out and have our tea on some sofas set outside. The truck drivers are joined by an older colleague who speaks fluent Romanian and who, inexplicably, likes driving in Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only at nightfall do we reach Trabzon, a very old and still important harbor. Right on the seashore, a colossal and deserted terrace houses several huge speakers which give out ear-splitting music. The speakers are covered in metal leaves fixed with some rocks which vibrate to the rhythm. I feel at home here. The official city guide mentions several times that Trabzon has seen countless ‘problems regarding breach of the peace’ along its tumultuous history. The atmosphere of ill-famed harbour in this old town gives us somewhat of an idea as to the problems. For the locals the main attraction is a new town centre, full of western stores and fast-food restaurants bearing American names.  The guide calls it ‘Champs-Élysées’. At nightfall, the shop windows become empty and not one woman is to be seen on the street. We’re awoken late at night by the honking of a convoy of cars celebrating a wedding and filming on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(458,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-06',NULL,NULL,'Trabzon – Topluca','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-449\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-450\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-451\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-452\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-453\" title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/51.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-454\" title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/61.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-455\" title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/71.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-456\" title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/81.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-457\" title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/91.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tea cultures start to ‘jostle through’ the hills of nut trees. In each town (somewhat big) there is a ÇAYKUR factory. Today we met the <a href=\"http://www.kon.org/urc/v7/yuksel-sokmen-2.html\">Lazi</a> community from the villages between Rize and the Georgian border. The Lazi are an ethnic group stemming from a former tribe of the Colchis Kingdom. Less than100.000 Lazi still live in Turkey, spread all over the villages on the Black Sea coast and in Georgia, over the border. Former warriors who survived in an extremely violent region, settled in the area before the Greeks and Turks, the Lazi speak an endangered language: the Lazuri. It wasn’t until the ‘60s that the Lazuri started to be researched and set in a written form by a German professor, Wolfgang Feurstein. In the past, the Turkish state (and before it, the Ottoman power) did its best to prevent the Lazuri from being spoken. For Turkish nationalism, minorities represent a danger, a direct threat to the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Lazi to whom we have spoken consider themselves to be Turks and have no claims whatsoever as to territory and autonomy. They only demand they keep their language and traditions. We reach Çaml?hem?in, a village considered a departure base for expeditions through the Kaçkar  Mountains. Now this is a very interesting moment as the national public broadcaster of Turkey (TRT) has sent a team to film the Lazi community. This is a first for the Lazi. No interviews are taken – the documentary focuses on cultural traditions (dances, songs, embroidery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Turkish colleague formally introduces us to the mukhtar, the head of the village in which they’re filming. A very solemn moment indeed. We sit on the chairs in front of a local tea house. We’re surrounded by some fifteen village men whose eyes gaze upon us with vivid interest. The only woman present is the TRT reporter who is also our interpreter. The mukhtar welcomes us and is curious to find out how we learned about the Lazi. He is very upset with most western reporters who thunder across the region and present them as barbarians. We explain to him what brings us to their region. The mukhtar advises us to be honest while someone adds jokingly that if we aren’t, they’ll look for us and find us wherever we go. And thus, with the last sip of tea, the meeting concludes: the mukhtar has accepted us and informs us we’re his guests and protégés. We will be spending the night in the village, at someone’s house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day comes to an end in a village higher up in the mountains, in Topluca, where the journalists and several village elders are invited over to the mukhtar’s house. The village is approximately 1.000 m away and the houses flow slantways in a stream. The recently built buildings are made of brick, have several storeys, running water, electricity and internet. The mukhtar apologizes for not being able to join us at dinner – he must work on his savage bees. The women prepare the food, serve it and aren’t allowed to eat until the men finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the colleague from TRT is present, I take the chance and ask if there are legends in the village about a creature living in the mountains: the <a href=\"http://www.gizliilimler.tr.gg/Germako%E7i.htm\">germakoçi</a>. The question generates a wrangle between the village elders and the photography director of the TRT team. The director takes out a bunch of prints from his bag and hands them to the cameraman to read out loud. The indignities read make one of the village elders whisper softly: ‘Allah, Allah!’ In brief, virtually nothing is known about the germakoçi, and its translation into Lazuri means ‘mountain man’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put up in a house from the village and, in order to show us the hospitality of the Lazi, several young men of the village keep us company until bedtime. We are served tea and challenged to a game of backgammon, where Petru? successfully represents our country. Unfortunately, we do not have an interpreter anymore so the following hours unfold to the sound of dice, interrupted from time to time by ‘pardon’ and ‘çok güzel’, at each doubles series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(466,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-07',NULL,NULL,'Topluca - Arhavi','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/52.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spend one more day in the Lazi villages. In the morning we learn that the mukhtar had forbidden the young men to surprise us in the dead of night as is the custom with guests come to visit for the first time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today the men of the village are dancing a local dance – <em>Horon</em> – on a 2.000 metre-high plateau. The TRT team are shooting several takes in various locations. We go up to the first filming location accompanied by Osman, a 55 year-old baker who worked in Zurich for thirty years. We talk in German. He emigrated when he was young, started his own family in Switzerland and now he has returned home. He wants to re-establish himself in his native village and travel to the surrounding countries he has never seen. He has three children – none of whom want to return to Turkey. They come only during the summer holiday. While we talk, the car almost reaches the plateau. On our left, the sea, on our right, the Kaçkar Summit (almost 4.000 metres). Nowadays, although they don’t have a certain traditional costume, men do have one element in common: revolvers. Living in a mountainous region, it is tradition that every man carry his own revolver. And on holidays each of them fires the revolver a few times into the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally reach the Isina plateau, the last filming location, where the mountains and the sea are much more visible. A cluster of shepherds’ houses seem to be inhabited. We ask if we can enter to take pictures and the people invite us to tea and halvah. Two men and six women are having lunch. The young man proudly shows us his revolver ‘destined’ for the animals in the forest. We finish our tea and, after we leave, they all get to work. The women let themselves in for carrying some wooden beams stored in the valley near the main road while the man with the cigarette in his mouth arranges them in front of the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every angle and manner of filming the <em>horon</em> have been exhausted, so it’s lunchtime. We descend from the plateau to where someone has brought bread, cheese and vegetables. I chat up another Osman, the same age as us, who has a <a href=\"http://www.macaheltur.com/\">tourism firm</a> in Arde?en. He organizes excursions in the mountains of the region and is thinking of moving to Istanbul. Among the packages he offers us there are several for Cuba. He tells me that he and his friends still speak Lazuri; however, slowly but surely the region is losing its young people. The children understand the language, but they don’t speak it so well anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their bellies full, the young men take out their revolvers and get ready for a target shooting contest. A car parked on the edge of the road is taken as a support point; on the opposite hill bottles, cucumbers and cigarettes pop up – everyone is setting up their own target. Up into the air we see Colt, Beretta, Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers and even a Luger. From pockets which earlier held seeds, now ammunition comes into sight. Some are sitting on the edge, admiring one another’s revolvers which are lying, together with the bullets, among the vegetables and cheese on the table. Others are firing several chargers into the air, whistling. Those who don’t have a revolver are taking pictures or making a video with their mobile phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoon the gathering is over. The mukhtar offers to put us up for another night, but we have to refuse. We reach Arhavi at night.

In Hopa, the road leaves the coast and runs up towards a huge reservoir on the way to Artvin. Gradually, the landscape undergoes a drastic change.  The region looks much more arid. We go up and down several plateaus – the highest: somewhere around 2.600 metres. We drive through a row of ghost towns, locations used by shepherds once a year during the transhumance period. We stop in one to stretch our legs a bit. An old man tells us he is the only inhabitant and asks for a cigarette. We don’t have any so we give him a tea bag instead. He seems content and wishes us god speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way to Ardahan and Kars small mountain villages heave up on the edge of the road, clearly much poorer than the shepherds’ villages on the coast. In Kars we’re told the region is purposely kept underdeveloped because Turks constitute the minority of the inhabitants. Besides, most of the inhabitants are Kurds. It is quite a hard-up region, but we have seen a lot of works being done to the infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We stop in one of these villages and go for a walk. Invitations to tea come pouring in. Everybody wants to have their picture taken – moreover, they all jot down their addresses and ask us to send them the printed pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We enter Kars at nightfall. Kars: a town with many recently built constructions planked between a century-old Russian houses, most of which are this close to caving in. Wide streets still preserve the organization and structure of a European town. We expect to see traces of extreme religion on the streets. Not by a long shot. In Kars there are three discos and two bars where most of those having alcohol are locals, not tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kars is a mosaic of Kurds, Turks, Armenians, Azerbaijanis and other nations. Perhaps this might be the reason why the police make a point of being visibly present on the streets, in fixed places, their beacon turned on during the night, their gun on view during the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(482,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-10',NULL,NULL,'Kars','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/25.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/34.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/44.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/53.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/62.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/72.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/82.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emin and Diba are two young men majoring in English at the University of Kars. They weren’t born here. Like many of their colleagues, they are Kurds and have come from other towns for their studies here. While we’re in town, they act as our interpreters. Moreover, they show us what young people do for fun in Kars and offer us their side of things on local issues; that’s how we end up playing rummy and drinking tea in a club for youngsters, among other students. They tell me it’s a great opportunity to practice their English conversational skills. They have tried to chat up tourists, but failed miserably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I was saying, minorities are an extremely sensitive issue in Turkey. There are only three <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/type,COUNTRYPROF,,TUR,4954ce3fc,0.html\">officially recognized minorities</a>: Armenians, Greeks and Jews. The rest are considered Turks and any official census completely ignores the ethnic appurtenance of Turkish citizens. Although they represent roughly 20% of Turkey’s population, the Kurds do not fall into the category of officially recognized minorities. In addition, any public statement regarding issues the Kurds or other minorities have may be interpreted as an insult to the Turkish state and constituted the object of a special bill, namely <a href=\"http://bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/122290-justice-minister-83-people-tried-under-article-301-in-3-years\">article 301</a> which states that imprisonment can last up to three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orhan Pamuk’s - the only Turkish writer to have received the Nobel Prize for Literature – statement regarding the 1915-1917 genocide of Armenians and the killing of 30.000 Kurds by the Turks, made the Turkish state bring charges against him using specifically article 301. Turkey does not recognize these numbers. Only Pamuk’s fame and virulent international reactions saved him from being imprisoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kars is the city where Pamuk’s political fiction, <em>Snow</em>, unfolds. The novel discusses the conflict between Islamists, secularists, the army and the Kurd and Turkish nationalists.  Such subjects are taboo among local journalists. We have visited four local editorial offices, one of them radio-TV, and, according to journalists, there aren’t any interethnic tensions whatsoever and everybody lives in peace and harmony. That is why the press covers differences between customs and traditions, such as local dances or songs. Administrative issues regarding the infrastructure are considered important topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical local editorial office (there are nine such offices, each addressing one of the local communities) consists of a room giving onto the street, two computers, an offset press from the’70s and a transceiver tuning in on the frequency of the police. A steamy kettle is always at hand. On average, papers usually print about 300 copies a day, some are given out for free and for others one has to make a subscription. They aren’t available at any of the stands in town. Journalists complain that people don’t read the newspaper anymore, that the press is stealing topics, articles and images. An important source of income is commercials and adverts paid by the government and local authorities. For some papers, it is their sole source of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tacettin Durmus, local journalist, is equipped with a camera, a video camera and a microphone. On his belt, the transceiver allowing him to follow the police frequency is buzzing away. He says working as a local journalist is pretty hard and some journalists even hold up two jobs. Two weeks a year he’s also a firefighter. During our talk he takes some pictures and at the Serhat TV editorial office he also films us. The following day people recognize us at the market, proof that our discussion has become local news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(484,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-11',NULL,NULL,'Kars – Tbilisi ','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/26.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/35.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4_1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/4_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/54.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday, after having finished the official visits, we went to the house of Emin and Diba’s colleagues. They are mostly young Kurds. Some of them are fine with opening a couple of beer cans. However, Emin tells us that he cannot bring girls over to his apartment, because the owner thinks he would be pointed at in Kars. The atmosphere heats up and the young men begin to dance a <em>hor?</em> which is similar to the <em>horon</em> seen in the Lazi community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emin and Diba tell us that in the beginning they had felt as strangers in Kars, people would throw mean glances at them if they spoke Kurdish on the street. Initially, their Turkish colleagues were quite distant, but they quickly struck up a friendship. There’s this general fear of what might happen should one speak publicly about the Kurdish issues. And there are countless rumours and contradictory information concerning mysterious disappearances of Kurdish activists, especially because of the JITEM - the army’s secret service. Otherwise, any young student, Turkish or Kurd, aspires to get to Istanbul, Ankara or somewhere in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left Kars around noon and went down a by-pass towards the border with Georgia, to Posof. Small parts of the road are still in construction, but the rest of the road ribbons along Lake Ç?ld?r, for about 2.000 metres. The 200-kilometre road to the border reaches even higher altitudes, among shepherds and militaries guarding the border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pass the Georgian border through an almost deserted customs point. The Turkish officials, very relaxed and without uniforms, welcome us with a Romanian ‘how do you do’. The customs officer can hardly take his eyes off one of Coelho’s books. Once we pass the border, the roads suddenly come to a halt. We enter Georgia via some rippled roads which come into contrast with the hi-tech equipment of the customs point. Out of the blue, mosques vanish into thin air. On the hills, ruins of fortresses and entrenched churches come into sight. Near Turkey, everything seems frozen in its Soviet past. Ruins and old houses. Virtually no new buildings whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We pass through Borjomi, a resort famous for its mineral water and spas. The entry into the resort is guarded by three huge former rest homes, looking as if they were occupied by sheer force. Each balcony has a different closure and each window is painted a different colour. We pull over and approach one of the rest houses. On the ground floor, in front of the former reception, a Lada is parked. The green space in front of the building has been transformed into a vegetable garden. Several children run about the ruins. An aged person explains that these are buildings inhabited by the refugees of wars in Abkhazia and Southern Ossetia. Over 300 souls. Across the hill there are two more such buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue our journey to Gori, where we put up for the night on Stalin Boulevard, across the road from the museum praising him. Hardly do we leave our baggage that we hurry to what seems as the only restaurant downtown. It appears to be a very luxurious location, former <em>Inturist</em> hotel. Only one table is occupied. Three citizens are standing up around it as if saying a prayer. The oldest is giving a never-ending toast – the two younger ones are staring deferentially into space. A few minutes later, the glasses of wine are knocked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We try the famous Georgian wine at an unaccountably small price. The citizens in the back stand up again. The same ritual unfolds. After a couple of minutes, the sound of a fist on the table disquiets the wine in our glasses and show us that at the neighbouring table the toasting has been going on for some time now. Hardly is the food set on the table that the inevitable occurs. The oldest of the Georgians, named Giga, tries in Russian, English and Georgian to invite us over to his table, under which two full carafes humbly await. The rather formal and solemn invitation lasts a good couple of minutes because Giga is carefully choosing his words in English and, after a while, he starts over. We pretend not to understand, but, at a certain point, Giga’s voice booms clear and unequivocal: ‘Peetree!’ We have already been made room for at the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cannot refuse local hospitality as we couldn’t refuse those litres of tea drunk in Turkey. Several hours of conversation follow in which all the earth’s languages - and even drawings on a sheet provided by Petru? - blend into one another. We come against a pretty unpleasant cultural difference. Nobody is allowed to drink while a toast is being held, which with Giga can take up to a quarter of an hour. Standing up. And when you’re finally allowed to, the glass of wine must be knocked back. From what we understand, Giga takes great joy in the friendship between the Georgians and the Romanians, which is actually being strengthened at this very moment. His opinion on the Russian people is rather harsh, judging after his stern face and his refusal to speak in Russian. At one point the glasses are exchanged for earthen jugs, clearly much more capacious. The jugs must also be date knocked back, but they give a handle for infinitely more formal toasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We feel faced with an important trial in our life, for which many Romanians train constantly, but do not make it to the day of the competition. It’s as if we’ve been suddenly summoned on the national team. I rush to the toilet and when I return Giga has turned on the music. A <em>hor?</em> is on. He has somehow gotten hold of Petre’s camera and is cheerfully taking pictures. One of the workers renovating the restaurant has heard the music and seems to be also tasting the wine. He seems as if he has been tasting it the whole day long. He learns that we are Romanina and he instantly bursts into cries of joy. He takes out his cross and starts to kiss it, dolefully murmuring something about Orthodox believers, patriarch and Orthodoxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As unexpectedly as it commenced, the party comes to an end. Giga invites us over to his house and it is at great pains that we manage to refuse him. He asks for our signatures to keep as memory and he gives us his own signature. Only the next day do we find out we had taken part in what Georgians call <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1033840\">Tamada</a> , a ritual named after the one making the toasts,  the person whom many sites also call ‘the dictator of the table’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following morning, after a short visit at Stalin’s museum (Stalin was born here), we set off for Tbilisi; however, not before Petrut sits on the armchair in which Stalin had sat on the train to Yalta. In Tbilisi, at the first junction I realize that I have been cutting lines. A policeman jumps in front of me, visibly content at the thought of a fine.  We tell him we are from Romania, he considers the situation and we turn on him with questions regarding the address we’re looking for. He beckons us to follow him and he leads us, riding his beacon-equipped scooter, straight to the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theblacksea.eu/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(504,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-14',NULL,NULL,'Tbilisi, Georgia','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/27.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/36.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/46.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"781\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/55.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the weekend we relaxed ourselves a bit by trying out several local temples of the Georgian wine. Cool and rotund carafes watching one like a hawk at every turn are the only real danger breathing down one’s neck in this country. (On sale for about 3 Euros/ one litre and a half) We start the week with a systematic tour of the city. For someone used to the hustle and bustle of Turkish towns, Tbilisi seems a dead city. Lateral little streets appear utterly deserted. The communists didn’t demolish a thing here and the Old Town stretches away between rocky hills separated by what appears to be a water stream. What the communists did overlook is be slowly, but surely, coming into being in this democratic Georgian era. The Old Centre – most of it, anyway – is on the verge of collapse. You won’t find a house that isn’t this close to crumbling down. Many are halfway collapsed and the half which is still standing seems to be accommodating people. From the street, one can see local house interior segments – living-rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens – halfway crumbled. The part still standing exposes the remaining wallpaper, furniture and other objects one usually finds in a house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One explanation for this disaster would be that in the rocky soil downtown there are massive water infiltrations which eat away at the foundations. There is also an obvious lack of money for more serious works. And yet, there are a few streets completely renovated where the houses look in mint condition. These are streets chock-full of restaurants and bars – at the tables, conversations in English prevail. An artificial graft on the Old Town’s ailing surface. A local journalist tells us there are business plans to transplant the inhabitants of the Old Centre into the new buildings. Those in charge of the operations intend to demolish the old houses and erect new constructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We quickly leave the Old Centre to go to the area of blocks of flats. The New Town continues on the right and left of the centre like Salvador Dalí’s flamboyant tapered moustaches, with pretty narrow segments of new neighborhoods. An underground dug deep connects the ends of the town. We admire that <em>je ne sais quoi</em> of communist blocks and the local craftsmen’s mastery. Everybody has closed up or extended the balcony his or her own way. Here it isn’t double glazing that spells new financial potency, but rather the possibility of extending one’s balcony, somewhere from the middle of the block, with a platform as wide as a new room. Such annexes embellish virtually every communist building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhere, in the middle of the city, when passing to the area of blocks, from a gangway in construction we see three bears. Small and scrawny, they mechanically sway to and fro, resembling a bunch of street children. Passers-by take their picture with the mobile phones. We approach what proves to be a Zoo in the middle of the city. Suddenly, the atmosphere quickly heats up. A river of children floods in through the narrow gates. And suddenly, it hits us – it’s June 1<sup>st</sup>: Children’s Day. The zoo park stretches along a communist block. Living in rather confined enclosures which lack vegetation, wolves, hyenas, cheetahs, panthers, monkeys, zebras and an elephant herd together. A pack of wolves is grinding against the bars – the leader of the pack, transfixed with pleasure, is scratched by the visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We exit the jungle and go for a bite to a terrace nearby. The speakers delight our ears with a Romanian <em>manea</em>, something about Mariana and Rodica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(508,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-15',NULL,NULL,'Nasi','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/28.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/37.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the town’s characteristics is that one can find accommodation with locals for about 10 Euros per bed. We experiment this type of accommodation for one night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There aren’t many locals who can afford to put up tourists and, therefore, the town centre is faced with a serious crisis of habitable space. In the days of the Soviet Union, old houses were taken possession of in a very comradely manner: everybody huddled together. Every room of former bourgeois houses would be inhabited by one family or another. Immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union, every family was returned its rightful property over its living space by the new Georgian state. The privileged ones who used to wallow in several rooms have retained their status of privilege. In Georgia there haven’t been any retrocession suits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put up at Nasi - former teacher of German - an old lady belonging to the class of the privileged. She owns the ground floor of a one-story house which is over one century old. It has five rooms and a veranda giving onto a patio. Two identical wings of this former mansion give onto the same patio. The rest of the building houses nine families altogether; the patio also serves as parking lot and as space for socializing. Nasi enlightens me: ‘My husband was a very wise man, a researcher. That’s why the state gave us a bigger house.’ Inside the house, not much has changed since the times of the Soviet Union. Not even the mattresses (a thing our backs have thoroughly experienced).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only two rooms are available to tourists. We choose the biggest. The framed Ph.D. diploma belonging to one of the children holds the place of honour among other family pictures.  A Chinese family of five lives in the former living-room - a passage way to our own room. They have improvised a partition wall by means of a rope on which several sheets are hanging. They also have a direct exit to the veranda which they’ve extended by a brick wall – their kitchen. Their personal belongings live in harmony with the old woman’s Soviet knick-knacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nasi is very optimistic. Her address is listed in guides such as <em>Lonely Planet</em> and she has developed her own network of partner pensions around the country. They recommend one another to tourists. She believes life has changed for the best and that hard times are far behind. In her opinion, the wars Georgia has been through are to blame for the lack of financial resources for any means of development – but she also believes that there will be no more wars. She breaks off her speech in German and concludes dryly: ‘Putin must go’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(514,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-15',NULL,NULL,'Tbilisi – Poti (via Kutaisi), Georgia','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/38.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although two main founders of the Soviet Union were Georgian – Stalin and Beria, his never-failing aid in matters of terror – Georgia wasn’t bestowed any privileges upon. On the contrary. We cross the country until we reach Poti, the country’s main harbour spanning about 350 kilometres, giving us the chance to observe what ‘Poppa’ <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/kars-%E2%80%93-tbilisi-484\">Stalin</a> – son of the town of Gori – gave his native country by strategic deportation and forced industrialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the deportations of various ethnic groups during the Soviet period, manifold pretexts for internal conflicts resulted in the Caucasian Republics, pretexts which at present prove to be very convenient to the geopolitical strategies of Kremlin leaders. The region faced its first anti-soviet rebellions in the 1920s. Along with declaring its independence from the Soviet Union, Georgia saw itself ruler of two republics considered separatist: Abkhazia and Southern Ossetia. Two fronts of armed struggle and almost 20 years of frozen conflict. Over 300.000 refugees fled to Georgia, escaping the separatist republics nowadays protected by the Russian army. Thousands of anti-personnel mines have pervaded the region. The border with Russia is closed for foreigners and the Georgians don’t use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the whirling car we can see the industry humbled to the dust, a familiar sight representative of the entire communist block. Near Kutaisi, colossal rusty iron constructions are on the verge of collapse. Factories and mounds of concrete, overrun by tropical vegetation, are keeping a close watch over the main road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A feeling of wilderness interweaves with the rustic scenery dominated by a myriad of churches, processions, priests and no end of women dressed in black. We learn that the custom is for women to prolong their mourning for life and never give up their widow’s weeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poti was occupied by the Russian army in 2008 when out Putin’s order to <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5147422.ece\">punish Saak\'ashvili in an exemplary manner </a> was carried out. Any movie about the Apocalypse could easily be shot here. One wouldn’t need any movie props or theatrical scenery which is completely unexpected since the harbour is an important element in the cargo transport to Europe. The local radio is just announcing the visit of the Georgian president in Romania and the project to transport gas from Azerbaijan via Poti to Constan?a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now a few general considerations about the Georgians’ adventures in traffic. The honk represents the most precious instrument for any respectable Georgian. During our stay here we’ve learned an entire language of honks. If, in a village, there are only two cars on the street at 5 a.m. they have to honk each other. In bigger towns, the main road is a pandemonium of honks similar to that of a metropolis. For overtaking, for people who wickedly try to use the pedestrian crossing, for crossing the red light, for going against traffic – for each and every one of these situations there is a type of honk. And the police run the show equipped with a panoply of strange sounds and a transmitter allowing them to bellow out indications, thus generating the envy of every driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the Caucasian states, <a href=\"http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/43314/E92789.pdf\">Georgia is at the top of a survey regarding road accidents </a> although it has the smallest number of cars. Behind every steering wheel there is a kamikaze without a clear objective. Apart from the challenges thrown by the other drivers, one must also face a slalom between endless numbers of cows occupying the main road as if they were in India. We also learn that there’s no such thing as a mandatory insurance as there isn’t any obligation of a periodical technical inspection. The traffic is quite aggressive and illogic, the roads are protected by a multitude of traditional carved wooden crosses in the memory of drivers fallen in the line of duty. The police are present in brand new cars, but don’t seem that interested in the abovementioned adventures of the road. A foreigner coordinating mine clearance operations has told me he’s much more worried about the fate of those on the road doing the minesweeping than the risks of operations on mine fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:///theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(519,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-16',NULL,NULL,'Batumi, Georgia','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/110.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/39.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/47.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/56.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/63.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/73.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/83.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our final destination is Batumi, the second largest Georgian harbour after Poti, but, at the same time, the most important resort for Georgians. After leaving behind Poti’s apocalyptic landscape, we hit the road, our minds imbued with all kind of scenarios. None of them positive. We drive through Kobuleti, a small Black Sea resort - with resorts on the shore - whose renovation works are in full swing. Elegant…fifty years ago. As we enter Batumi, we regain our composure – it’s a town whose architecture is distinctive of Tsarist Russia, a town in which huge investments have been made. By the sea, old one-story stone houses with long wooden terraces stand as if arranged on a string. Behind them, concrete towers heave into view, future luxury hotels glued to the sea, but pretty decent-looking in key with what seems to be a general and organized plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Old Centre in the harbour area still preserves its authentic atmosphere. The sewage system and street renovations are being worked on tooth and nail. A mind of genius has suddenly thought of ‘laying open’ every street downtown, although only a handful of workers are involved in the renovation process. That translates into a horrid car ride in search of a hotel. The car dances from one crater to another. Besides, it seems the locals are having fun by randomly posting hotel signs on buildings. We enter such buildings a couple of times ‘fascinated’ by the firm sign which say those are hotels. We make our exit the same way we made our entrance. No trace of a hotel or of renovation works. An old woman crocheting and a bored neighbour explain through gestures that there isn’t any hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old harbour is used less and less. On shore we see a school-ship and a hotel imitating an old wooden ship. The cargo harbour, though not very in demand nowadays, still delivers enough sailors who add a bit of colour to the bars of the Old Town centre. Right next to the harbour the ratchel beach starts off. At lunchtime, the place becomes flooded with children coming from school. In front of us, a more animated group of students leave their backpacks and start to gather seashells which they cook on a tray on an improvised fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beach stretches out for many more kilometres and here’s where massive investments in Batumi are really striking. Local journalists maintain that many luxury constructions are just means of money laundering. Old buildings that have been renovated look so new that they actually resemble theatre scenery. A Sheraton has already been opened and next in line are Hilton, Hyatt and other similar names. Casinos are also part of future business plans though they are strictly forbidden in Turkey, the neighbouring country. Renovations and newly erected buildings have transformed this part of town into an immense all-inclusive resort. When the works are done, great part of Batumi will look as kitsch as Disneyland, but it will surely constitute a great tourist attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goods harbour in Batumi has been leased for a period of 49 years to KazTransOil, subsidiary of the KazMunayGaz Group which purchased Rompetrol from Dinu Patriciu<sup>1</sup>. Georgia is packed with Rompetrol gas stations and Patriciu’s name comes up quite often in articles written by journalists in Tbilisi. Together with a former Georgian prime-minister he has bought shares in a local bank. Journalists say that Patriciu is interested in real estate projects in Batumi and he is currently running negotiations for gas exploitation licences in the Black Sea, out on the Georgian coast. Who knows...maybe at the next Georgian presidential elections, Saak\'ashvili will babble:“???????? …??????????!” (approximate translation: ‘Shame on you, Dinu Patriciu!’)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 <strong>Dinu Patriciu</strong>: chairman of the board and CEO of the Rompetrol Group, NV.

The Mingrelians and the Lazi were part of the same people a long time ago and lived in the region comprising Sukhumi (Abkhazia) and Trabzon (Turkey). The Turks conquered part of this territory and assimilated the Lazi, while the Mingrelians remained on the Georgian territory. The Lazi are Muslims and the Mingrelians Christians. Their language shares a common root, but it was influenced by Russian in the case of the Mingrelians and by Turkish, Greek and Arabic in the case of the Lazi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We meet Givi at a terrace in Tbilisi, not far from a summer theatre in a park where from time to time concerts with Mingrelian and Lazi music are organized. Givi is the logistic manager of a cargo firm which operates on the Tbilisi airport. He spends his leisure time gathering Mingrelian words, stories and songs. He shows an equal interest for the fate of his neighbours, the Lazi. He informs us he’s putting together a manuscript for publication; the manuscript discusses surnames in the Lazi culture, surnames which were forcibly changed to Turkish on the other side of the border. ‘Unfortunately, our language is dying away. No sustained efforts are done to keep it alive.’ Givi says that some Georgian nationalists are claiming Mingrelian doesn’t exist and that what he speaks in his family is actually a Georgian dialect. Moreover, the same voices maintain that the Mingrelians are an investment of Russian secret services whose goal is to tear Georgia apart. Such theories are grounded in the fear that, should the Mingrelian language be preserved and officially recognized, the Mingrelians might make territorial claims. ‘It’s absurd. If I try to carry out any project involving the Mingrelians, I am suddenly perceived as an enemy of the Georgian state’ Givi complains. He also tells us that the <a href=\"http://www.gizliilimler.tr.gg/Germako%E7i.htm\">germakoci</a> does indeed exist and that it has a counterpart in the Mingrelian culture: the ocokoci, a hideous creature with fangs on its chest which lives up in the mountains and howls from time to time, more precisely, when it chases princesses: ‘My aunt swears she heard a ocokoci howl’ Givi telss me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beso, another Mingrelian we met in Zugdidi, offers us a different view of things. Beso is a musician (he sings at chongs), knows how to stitch and has a degree in gardening and landscape art. Zugdidi is considered the Mingrelian capital and the main attraction is the Dadiani Palace – the palace of the family who ruled Mingrelia and at one point became related to Napoleon’s family. Beso proudly gives us a tour of the museum inside the palace whose central point is one of Napoleon’s three death masks. In the days of the Soviet  Union, communist leaders would organize bean-feasts in the main room of the palace at the table where former princes used to sit. They loved drinking and eating from the aristocracy’s dinner service exhibited in the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beso’s relationship with the authorities is very affable. He makes his living from gardening and is proud to inform us that his major contracts are financed by the town hall. He has created the garden in front of the palace, has planted trees all over town and he has built a garden in the tent sheltering the skating ring. The plants are imported from Italy and he is currently planning to open up a nursery garden. Furthermore, Beso wants to build himself a pension for tourists which would also be used for camps for Lazi and Mingrelian children: ‘Children don’t speak our language anymore; it’s a miracle it has lasted so far.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(536,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-20',NULL,NULL,'Zugdidi – Mestia, Georgia ','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/112.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/212.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving on our last vapours of oil and blessed with the first raindrops, we enter Mestia at high speed. Mestia is a highland townlet up in the Caucasus Mountains, more precisely the Svaneti region. From the dust cloud left behind, the police jeep we saw on the road and which escorted us for a while emerges. Our car went as fast as it could on vapours, but it was already coughing when we entered Mestia. We forgot to fill her up and there are no gas stations whatsoever along the 140-km road from Zgudidi to the highlands. We actually came across one with archaic pumps – but it was closed. However, an abacus and a receipt book in the window give me an inkling that it does operate now and then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police said they’d follow us just to make sure we wouldn’t be left on the road. We communicated in Russian, gesturing fervently. 35 km of potholes and ticking over to spare fuel. This is the second time we reach our destination under Georgian police guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil pump is dead – apparently there isn’t any fuel. The car cannot move. After a quick words exchange between the chief of the police patrol and the salesman, somebody appears from behind carrying a big metal bucket. Somewhere somehow the last 20 litres were actually ‘dug up’. I really hope it is fuel oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to get a look at Georgia’s most isolated part, the Svaneti region, sandwiched between the sea and the border with Abkhazia and Russia. This is a region which speaks volumes about any Caucasian state – its isolation is illustrative of the area. We drive up a 140-km road, over half of it turned into a logging road washed down by the waters of glaciers under which it passes. At present it’s in the heat of reconstruction works. On small segments we wait for the bulldozers to dig into the rock and level the road with the caterpillars so we can move on. We enter carved caves which stand for tunnels. We pass over hills and road humps highly unsuitable for our car, a Ford Focus, its guard pretty down. Next to us Ladas, Volgas and other Soviet cars sprightly romp around. This is simply a spectacular region. We drive along the Inguri River which separates Georgia from Abkhazia and empties into the sea. We pass through a 2000-metre high gulch and around us over 4000-metre high still snowbound crests appear. For centuries Georgians have used this region as their refuge, an unassailable natural fortress. When they felt they were losing ground with invaders, they would go up to Svaneti to hide their icons, treasures and even their rulers. Each village developed around a group of stone houses. Each house has its own fortified tower where the family would retreat in case of defence. Georgians boast of never having been conquered in this region. The first uprisings against the Soviets started here, in Svaneti, in the ‘20s, but were quickly quenched in blood when they spread to the rest of Georgia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(544,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-22',NULL,NULL,'Ushguli, Georgia ','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/113.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/213.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/311.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mestia is the last settlement our car has access to. From here on we rent a Jeep for the next 45 km – and yet the ride takes about three hours. We want to reach Ushguli, one of the highest villages in Europe – and one of the oldest, most isolated ones. We gain access by means of a wider foot path, wide enough for a car to pass. On the road I gain a deeper insight on what a truly isolated region it actually is. Mestia is severed from the rest of the country by snow three months a year and from Ushguli six-seven months a year. Mestia can be reached by helicopter in case of emergency, but Ushguli, home to almost 50 families live, is unreachable. We’re at over 2000 metres altitude at the foot of the highest summit in Georgia – Shkhara (over 5.000 metres).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concern the police manifested for us the day before wasn’t random. In this region, both the army and the police are bound to take care of tourists. They constantly patrol the zone and take a thorough interest in who goes where and for how long. Even the local policeman of Ushguli, a middle-aged local wearing a sort of American uniform, blue cap and sunglasses, followed me into a shop to check if the saleswoman had given me the change correctly. According to the locals, six years ago, the region was virtually unworkable because of a clan – from a village near Mestia – who controlled it. The Aprasidze family would run unlawful operations against tourists, but also locals. In 2004, after the Rose Revolution, the newly elected president Saak\'ashvili gave a personal order for the clan to be annihilated through an operation of wide scope. The leader of the gang – the father and his four sons together with a Russian fellow villager – barricaded themselves in the fortified family tower as the custom was in times of dire straits. Except that in the past there were no missiles and helicopters. This law enforcement operation required 12 helicopters and several hundred officers. The Ombudsman <a href=\"http://www.ombudsman.ge/index.php?page=1001&amp;lang=1&amp;id=1115\">defined the operation </a> as a serious breach of human rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, after two members of the clan were killed and the rest imprisoned, tourists started to slowly appear in the region. Foreigners, of course, because the region is listed in <em>Lonely Planet</em>. Going up towards Ushguli in the wilderness, navigating through cows and semi-wild boar families, an army SUV finds a spot to pass us up. A long-haired Japanese wearing a red Gore-Tex, knees to his chin, glued to a mountain bike the same colour as his jacket stoically makes his way through the militaries. He is lucky. We learn the militaries convey all the tourists to make sure nothing happens to them. They even accept do it for free by means of a military plane (between Mestia and Kutaisi) when they have available places; otherwise, such a journey normally lasts 5 hours by car.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(547,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-23',NULL,NULL,'Mestia – Tbilisi, Georgia','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/115.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/214.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/312.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/48.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their poverty, their violent past and their ubiquitous police, the locals take kindly to foreigners. Our vehicle with its unknown tag and inadequate car body is a real sight. The road workers help me with directions on difficult segments. A truck driver coming against traffic starts to honk and flash his lights, just like a strobe light. In the end he takes his head out the window and yells laughing: ‘Romaniaaaa!’ At a stop-over, I leave Petru?’s side for two minutes to go ask for oil; next thing I know, I find him in a village market at a table flanked by two locals, a glass full of vodka in one hand and a snack in the other. One of the villagers, a bit heavy and full of tattoos, has his hand over Petru?’s shoulders and is insistently nudging him to knock down the vodka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back from Ushguli to Zugdidi I begin to better understand what every villager in the highlands constantly reiterated: isolation, their former advantage, has become their greatest curse. A little over four thousand people live in the entire region of Svaneti. In any settlement there are visible signs of abandonment, many empty houses on the verge of decay. People long for a permanent and easily accessible connection and that’s the reason why they have their hopes set on the quick rehabilitation of the road we’re jolting on. Nowadays, nobody is willing to live in a region resembling a fortress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children from Ushguli rarely reach Mestia and almost never go beyond it. For the people of Mestia two trips a year to Zgudidi are quite a luxury (students need to go buy their school books).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Ushguli 50 children attend school crammed in tiny classrooms of ten sq. metres. Gathered in the teachers’ lounge, the primary school teachers complain that this impracticable region becomes a nightmare in wintertime. The principal tells us they have no teacher of English anymore; at present all the kids are learning German. The computer on her desk is used only for playing games – only next year do they expect to get an Internet connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists aren’t perceived yet as an important source of income. And the expectations in this respect vary. We’ve talked to a carpenter who makes a living by selling souvenirs (a schoolgirl from Mestia does the interpreting). Besik hopes the newly constructed road will bring more tourists because this way he could give up agriculture and live solely on selling his souvenirs. His neighbours, however, the Ratiani family (a big family with eight children to raise) have another view on things: the few tourists that reach the highlands have become a cause of dispute, envy and scandal in this otherwise very fused community. The only subject on which everybody agrees is that they cannot wait for the road to be asphalted. As for myself, I push start the car downwards and am eager to reach the asphalt with the vehicle ‘safe and sound’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(553,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-24',NULL,NULL,'Tbilisi in Petrut’s view','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/116.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/215.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/313.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/49.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/57.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/64.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/74.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/84.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/92.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking photographs in Turkey seemed much easier. No matter if you were in Ankara or a small mountain village, the streets were teeming with people who sold, bought, pushed, pulled, lifted, ate, cut hair, drank tea or simply didn’t do anything. All you had to do was walk and choose whatever scene you wanted to immortalize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the growing heat has something to do with it, but if you take a walk in Georgia you won’t see a soul on the street. Especially in Old Tbilisi where each time I asked where the people were, I got raised shoulders for answers. The linguistic barrier was set and I was gazing blankly at it waiting for some kind-hearted man to raise it. Apparently everything happens inside common patios (called Italian patios). I wanted to talk to the people of Tbilisi and record on film their secret life unfolding inside their houses. Secret to me, but normal to them. I tried to let myself into their patios and explain by gestures what I wanted to do, but things became a bit complicated because of my overall appearance: I had a rather dubious ‘bald fade’ haircut, consequence of a small misunderstanding with a Georgian barber. I was desperate and this close to giving up and turning to photograph monuments and churches when ?tefan told me he had found a student who could help with the interpreting for a few hours. Mari is in her third year at the University  of Tbilisi and is majoring in Politology; she apologizes for not being able to stay long as she has to get back home and look after her little sister. I tell her I want us to take a walk in the Old Centre so I can steal a glance at people’s patios; if and where I find something interesting, I’ll tell her to ask them to let us in so we can take pictures. She seems a bit surprised I don’t want to photograph the famous Georgian churches, but she briskly gets down to business and, in two shakes of a lamb’s tail, there I am, photographing a man who, having been literally ambushed by us, didn’t even get to close up his shirt. A few minutes later, there I am again, taking photos of a young footballer buried among icons after which I make my exit, my photo backpack heavier by 750 ml – in translation: Georgian cognac, a gift from the locals. Obviously the whole situation is beyond me. Mari enters patios, knocks on doors or yells, people get out, we talk to them for about two seconds and the pictures unfurl like wildfire. What I photograph is none of my choice. Mari is in a hurry; however, she gives it her best and manages to offer me a two-hour <em>tour de force</em>. The entire situation is starting to amuse me - especially as the people’s reaction is most natural. They almost apologize for not expecting my visit. None of them refuse me and the hardest part is turning down their offer to stay longer. The buildings are in pretty bad shape, but the common yards and small space shared by many families seem to have fused the Georgian community even more. They cook together, they drink, they laugh and they laze away together, they help one another with renovations and they remain friends. Mari tells me they keep in touch even after they move out. I remember I lived in a studio in Bucharest for 10 years and when I left I didn’t know even one neighbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(565,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-25',NULL,NULL,'Media in Georgia','<p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"25\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/25-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p>These days, the Georgian press is thoroughly analyzing a smashing thrashing in the studio of an <a href=\"http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22278\">important television studio</a>. Several leaders of a radical Orthodox Christian group gave their opponents a scrumptious Christian beating. A few journalists also cashed in a couple of blessed blasts. Not long ago, <a href=\"http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=22080\">another television </a>stirred panic throughout the country with a live broadcast of an invasion of Russian tanks, a report invented and directed through and through.</p>\r\n<p>This may seem odd, but the press in Georgia took a big step backwards the moment the country ‘gained’ a bit more democracy and set out to eradicate the prevailing corruption. That is, right after the Rose Revolution when Mikheil Saak\'ashvili (Misha) became president. As a consequence of overthrowing Shevardnadze’s corrupt and pro-Soviet regime, critical and investigative journalism began to fade out. After several years of confusion, an alternative press established itself on the Internet, making the most of social networking websites to promote their materials. The rest of the press is very poorly developed professionally, ultra-politicized and smothered by broadcasting press conferences as major events (sound familiar?).</p>\r\n<p>The explanation resides, of course, in the stockholders of newspapers and radio-TV stations. It is quite difficult to find information on who is behind corporations owning media companies. A recent report of OSCE regarding municipal elections emphasizes this aspect <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2010/05/44179_en.pdf\">in the chapter on media</a>. It basically discusses politicians or influential businessmen whose businesses extend beyond the field of mass media. More often than not, the same person is a politician, businessman and media owner (for example, the mayor of <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/batumi-%E2%80%93-zugdidi-georgia-529\">Zugdidi</a>). Generalized corruption (small corruption) is indeed on its last legs, but the new regime has paved the way for big businesses under government control, hidden by fiscal paradises to which oligarchs owning media companies also have access. Furthermore, controlling the press by state debt amnesty and government advertising applies also here. The government has recently proposed wiping the slate clean with state debt amnesty for all TV stations (over 10 million Euros) without mentioning, however, the sum each TV stations owes the state. The state debt of each television is considered commercial secret. The state has constantly refused to make them public and the TV stations all the more so.</p>\r\n<p>Nino Zuriashvili, along with her colleagues, used to produce one of Rustavi 2\'s (a private TV station) most thorough investigative reports (the ‘60 minutes’ format). After the Democrats came to power, their programme was taken off the air. Its producer is now running a business programme. Nino and some of her colleagues started their own investigative reports on the new governments. However, they quickly realized they had run out of clients. An investigation on the way special operations to crush criminality are run in the Svaneti region came against the same partners’ refusal to broadcast it. The material clearly showed a chief of special operations take advantage of his troops’ presence in the region to solve an affair by military means.</p>\r\n<p>Her reports were turned down (though they had been offered for free) by every TV station and, obviously, by the public television. Nino set up her own investigative production company, Monitor Studio, and is publishing online together with other independent producers (<a href=\"http://www.ijp.ge/\">www.ijp.ge</a>). Traditional journalism indulges in a fierce partiality without digging around huge businesses of the government and president Saak\'ashvili’s clientele. Day by day, a large part of the press sing Misha’s praises whose face and heroic deeds appear constantly in newspapers, on TV and street billboards. Prime-time news on the president’s visit to a foreign country lasts about 15 minutes. Various shots quickly alternate and have to be broadcast a couple of times more to accompany the stream of significant details such as the name of each person Misha shook hands with.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px;\"><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(571,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-28',NULL,NULL,'Tbilisi, Georgia – Yerevan, Armenia','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/117.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/216.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/314.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re in the heart of the Caucasian maze. Geographical logic would have bore us from Kars, Turkey, right to Yerevan, Armenia. The border was closed by the Turkish government over seventeen years ago for several reasons: the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, the official requests of Armenia to recognize the 1915 Turkish genocide of Armenians and unofficial disputes regarding the present-day Armenian territory which no longer comprises Mount Ararat and the region of Kars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way into Armenia is through Georgia. Actually, it is also the only way out as the entire border with Azerbaijan has been both closed and fortified ever since the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh which started over twenty years ago. Armenia is sandwiched between two countries with which it cannot communicate. A strip of land in Southern Armenia harbours a customs-passage point with Iran. Moreover, in the South-Western part, Armenia also comprises Nakhchivan, the landlocked exclave of Azerbaijan, a region which has been the bone of contention between the Armenians and the Azerbaijani for centuries, a battlefield which has seen countless and repeated interethnic massacres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For causes which have yet to be clarified, Georgia is very chary of highway maps – merchandise virtually impossible to find. The Google map doesn’t even feature the main roads. So we ended up losing our way from Tbilisi to Yerevan and reached an almost deserted and outlandish land border: Guguti-Tashir. The roads in and out of Georgia seem to be the subject of a defence strategy – they are destroyed by craters so that potential invaders make their way in <em>slow motion</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We get our Armenian visa in ten minutes and optimistically receive the welcome greetings of the customs officers. Passing the customs point turns out to be quite a delicate operation – very representative of a country smothered by red tape and corruption. Five employees with various positions in one single office work for an hour and manage to provide us with ten different papers in order to let us go. In the end, all we see is the copy of some receipt. We pay about 70$ for a 14-day pass on the roads of Armenia. Otherwise, the group of officials is very friendly and kind. After repeated yells, the head of the customs officers even wakes up from the bed he had improvised behind the desk. He interrupts his afternoon nap and his subordinates follow suit. They stop their PC poker game to check if the car was stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our way to Yerevan, we pass through a barren and mountainous landscape, very similar to the villages in <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/arhavi-%E2%80%93-kars-472\">Kars</a>, Turkey. For the first time on this journey, I have the distinct impression of having entered a Soviet country. The reason: the ubiquitous police with their brand-new cars, Western limos, though they display an attitude typical of the militia - the Soviet cap with its huge peak pulled back and a beer belly, proudly jutted out, pouring over their trousers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The militiamen represent only the prelude to the similar atmosphere of Yerevan, the capital.  At first sight, the city seems right in line with other Soviet cities: renovated buildings from Stalin’s days, large boulevards, generous monuments and squares, outskirts teeming with Communist apartment buildings. And yet, the atmosphere is a very relaxing one: hills near by, a row of greenery, downtown Yerevan encircled by crowded terraces. Moreover, unlike the landscape of Tbilisi, the shops, the streetlights and the crowds in any day of the week give one the impression of luxury. At sunset, in Republic Square, hundreds of people watch the show: an artesian well accompanied by a strobe light. The loudspeakers pour out music by Charles Aznavour, while, in the background, one can make out Mount Ararat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old, hidden and crammed houses from past centuries emerge from behind apartment buildings. Many tall buildings with luxury apartments have taken their place. Tourists often complain Yerevan is a very expensive city, especially when it comes to hotels. Two beds in a hostel downtown cost more than renting an apartment by the day. And yet, the boulevards are swamped with overcrowded cafés even at midnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind lit façades, poverty lurks. In the building where we rented an apartment, the water’s cut off from midnight till morning, and from time to time even the electricity. Depending on the area, the entire city suffers from regular shorter or longer water / electricity failures. The neighbour below us knocks alarmed at out door. He commands me in a shrill Russian voice to turn the water off and grabs me by the hand to show me the flooding. Although this is an ultra central building, the apartment hasn’t been renovated for tens of years. The kitchen is equipped with just a gas cylinder with a burner. On the balcony, the old man has built himself a little workshop where he works on some silvery daggers which he sells at the souvenir fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(575,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-29',NULL,NULL,'Pagranichnyie Slujba Rossii','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/118.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/217.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multitude of luxury stores, crowded terraces, renovated boulevards and the monuments of Yerevan doesn’t originate from exemplary economy, but from the Diaspora. Only a third of Armenians live in the country. The rest - around six million - are spread all over the world. According to locals, the Diaspora is for Armenia what oil is for Azerbaijan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And just like in Azerbaijan, Armenia’s main resource is irrationally exploited by politicians. A blend of organized crime, government leaders and parliamentarians. Profitable businesses are in the hands of politicians and so is spending public money without any government transparency. The journalists we’ve talked to claim that great part of the money is laundered by building new residential luxury complexes, the so-called ‘apartments of the elite’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around one million people live in Armenia’s capital, approximately a third of the country’s population. The rest of Armenia doesn’t enjoy the lifestyle of Yerevan, not by a long shot; on the contrary, according to official statistics, a large part is struggling with extreme poverty. We ask two local journalists to show us a few villages on the border with Turkey, a border nobody can pass. We drive through Ejmiatsin to Margara, a former customs point not far from Ararat. Many villages seem deserted. Here and there, car skeletons lay among bunkers and tank turrets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peasants complain business is done at their expense using irrigation water and agricultural credits – nobody receives any subsidies from the government; they’ve all got bank debts to pay. And yet, like the rest of the Black Sea region, this doesn’t prevent them from being extremely hospitable. A woman invites us to her house and offers us coffee and candy. The children are sent to pick cherries; out of nowhere, tomatoes, fresh goat cheese and home-baked <em>lavash</em> appear. On TV a video of the youngest son’s eighth grade graduation party is running. The head of the family shows up, straight from work, carrying a bag of vegetables. He’s glad to have guests – this way he can take a little break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We quickly find out the border with Turkey (and Iran) is guarded mainly by Russian officers. Russian troops stationed in Armenia number about 5.000 people. Sona, the journalist who accompanies us, wants us to get a closer look at the Turkish border. This is her first time in the area also, so we both rely on Grisha, her colleague, a local journalist who says he has taken pictures right next to the barbed wire fence separating the two countries. In Margara we are invited to park the car in a courtyard giving onto the border. Four journalists next to the fence marking the border of the Soviet Union, a fence identical to the one I saw a long time ago in the Republic of Moldova. We fall behind while the journalists take pictures. Not too far away, a border guard is staring at us with his binoculars from his observation tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a little while, a black BMW jeep with smoky windows is coming towards us. Four solid young men, wearing undershirts and flip-flops get placidly out of the car. They’re also wearing camouflage trousers – a sort of training. They honk at us from afar and beckon us to turn away from the fence. One of them has a military transmitter in his hand. He politely introduces himself in Russian: ‘Pagranichnyie Slujba Rossii’. He requests to see our documents. Sona tells them we are journalists which triggers about three hours of parleying, controls and waiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian patrol guards seem rather amused at the thought of what we’re in for. They comment on our visas which they pass from one hand to another. They hold back our documents and ask us to follow them to the military unit, 500 metres down the road. There, a young, blond superior officer with a childish figure takes over our case. He tells the journalists taking pictures on the border is strictly forbidden and that we are to wait for him to report the incident and decide our fate. After a while, he exits the unit and informs us we’re going to get off easy this time, but that we have to follow him to the Town Hall where he will train us with regards to border behaviour. He also informs us an Armenian intelligence officer is already on his way over to investigate the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reach the Town Hall. The Russian officer plants a chair in the middle of a spacious room. The four of us huddled up together on an uncomfortable sofa, our backs to the wall. We’re offered coffee. On a very official tone he explains – and Sona translates – that they might detain us for 48 hours. Who infringed which law still remains somewhat hazy. In the end, we are told foreigners aren’t allowed to come closer than one kilometre from the border. We now stand as potential spies. He questions us about our jobs. He tells Sona he is from Kaliningrad, went to military academy and was, afterwards, sent to the Armenian border. He asks her if the same goes for journalists, if they are assigned their jobs. The atmosphere is pretty relaxed until the intelligence officer, in civilian clothes, shows up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our documents are examined yet again, every page of the passport photocopied. The officer reports to the centre, while the Russian continues his nosing around: why do you travel only to conflict areas? Sona’s editor is already calling the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to complain about the situation. After more than two hours, we tell them we’re very grateful for the hospitality, but we must contact our embassy in case they decide to keep us detained. We are told in an official stance that the maximum they are allowed to detain us is four hours. They’re just waiting for a call from the Ministry. Pretty soon the call comes through, the intelligence officer puts on a smile, returns our documents and wishes us a safe trip. The local journalists exchange phone numbers with the officers. To make sure we do leave the area, the officer dressed in civilian clothing in a Lada Niva and the Russian border guard in a military jeep drive before us. Two jeeps with Iranian tags heading merrily towards Ararat speed by us from the opposite direction. Our escort is in a thundering rage. The cars suddenly break, turn around and drive off like a whirlwind after the Iranians. The fun continues on the border with Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(580,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-06-30',NULL,NULL,'Radio Yerevan','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/06/119.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p>Sona Avagyan and Grisha Balasanyan are journalists working for <em><a href=\"http://www.hetq.am/\">Hetq</a>,</em> a weekly journal of the Association of Investigative Journalists of Armenia. They accompany us to the border to show us the region and help with the interpreting. Sona showed up with a big plastic bag, several tens of copies of the paper he works at. While we talk and walk the streets, Sona gives out papers left and right. Grisha falls behind to discuss his articles with the peasants gathered in front of the dilapidated community centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the only way an independent journal critical of its government can make it outside Yerevan. Otherwise, <em>Hetq</em> is sold only in the capital – totalling 2.000 copies. It is a journal which was first published in print seven months ago. Other journals which have been on the market for some years now usually sell around 3.000-7.000 copies. They lack credibility and are much too politically biased. Advertisement and politics are strictly interconnected. Who pays for an ad that isn’t to the government’s liking can expect to receive sudden controls from fiscal inspectors. The total newspaper circulation in Armenia does not exceed 30.000 copies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, press isn’t a business. That means it craves professionalism. Edik Bagdasarian is the editor-in-chief of <em>Hetq</em> and the head of the investigative association. Edik has written investigative and critical articles for several years and tells me he constantly receives threats because the government and parliament have strong connections with organized crime groups. About a year and a half ago, he was attacked on the street and beaten up until he lost consciousness. The police mimed the investigation in his case. Edik maintains that broadcast media <a href=\"http://hetq.am/en/media/broadcast/\">is subject to government control</a>, even if in some cases businessmen are pushed to the foreground. Firms in general and media companies in particular are very difficult to investigate – one cannot inquire or be provided with information regarding them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beatings, imprisonment and even crimes against Armenian journalists have quenched the thirst for investigative and critical materials. Mark Grigorian, an investigative journalist preparing a material on the 1999 commando assault on the Parliament, was badly injured when <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/armenia-grenade-attack-injures-24-10-2002,04157.html\">a grenade exploded right at his feet</a> in an attempt to prevent the publication of the article. He chose to leave the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The governments which have alternately come to power don’t seem to hold human rights in high esteem. Two years ago, the news media became paralysed in the wake of the <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/armenia-with-news-media-paralysed-and-05-03-2008,26025.html\">20-day state of emergency</a> proclaimed after violent clashes between security forces and opposition protesters. And right when we were on our way out of Armenia, U.N. official, a special rapporteur on the conditions of human rights defenders <a href=\"http://www.azatutyun.am/content/article/2075965.html\">openly deplored</a> the restrictions imposed by the government and the newly enacted legislation on television and radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(585,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-01',NULL,NULL,'Yerevan – Stepanakert, NKR','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A great part of Armenia’s international issues are connected to the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), a <em>de facto</em> independent republic (which is not recognized internationally) numbering 140.000 inhabitants. The conflict between Armenians and the Azerbaijani took a violent turn in 1988 and lasted until 1994. Both sides committed many atrocities; the aftermath: 30.000 people lost their lives. Almost 600.000 Azerbaijani in Karabakh fled the region for Azerbaijan and even today they fall in the category of ‘internally displaced persons’ (IDPs). Each side claims abuse from its rival. The fact is that misinformation, challenges, conspiracy theories and the involvement of the Soviet Secret Services at first and of the newly established Azeri and Armenian ones subsequently prevailed throughout the entire conflict. Internal fights for power in the new states of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the beginning of the ‘90s also influenced the evolution of the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wars over NKR territory control have been going on for several years now. The interethnic conflict was reinforced when the Soviets established control over the area, providing every newly set up Soviet Republic with an autonomous region: Nakhchivan for Armenia and Karabakh for Azerbaijan. Add to this the Soviets’ habit of strategic displacements of large parts of the population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last conflict, Azerbaijan was vanquished and the Azeri people had to flee the region. At present, the NKR is financially supported by Armenia and the Diaspora and is under Russia’s political protection. The borders with Azerbaijan aren’t very clearly defined; there is a rather large buffer area unmarked on the map. The only way into the NKR is in the South, via the Armenian town of Goris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A coloured placard I barely make out after I pass it interrupts the monotony of winding turns on a high plateau. I realize we have entered NKR territory. The sudden improvement of road quality is explained by placards announcing ‘the highway’ we’re driving on was built with the help of ‘the Armenian people’. Other plates bear the name of businessmen who participated at the reconstruction of certain parts of the road. There are neither customs points, nor soldiers, nor barriers. When we enter Berdzor a policeman beckons me to pull over. He marks our passports and the car number on a register and bids us safe journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NKR visa is necessary only when leaving the territory. We get it the following day, in ten minutes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stepanakert, the capital of the Republic. We fill in a form on the spot and pay around 10 $ a person. As entering this territory is considered illegal by the Azerbaijani government, we request they do not stick the visa to our passports. They give it separately. Along with the visa we are given a written permission comprising the towns we’re allowed to visit. ‘If you take pictures of military objectives, you will be punished’ the official handing out the visas warns us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entrance into the Republic and the drive to Stepanakert don’t reveal a region which was subject to a prolonged war and intense bombardment. This region has been rebuilt almost completely and the fields have undergone mine clearance operations. Moreover, downtown Stepanakert - a town of 50.000 people - has seen several serious investments. The renovation of a central square is very close to completion, an esplanade flanked by a glass wall and connected to a brand new stadium through a long staircase. That is the new Parliament Building and, glued to it, the <em>Armenia</em> luxury hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s get one thing straight. Stepanakert doesn’t look like a new town, but Communist buildings are still standing. Most of them were completely destroyed by Azerbaijani artillery. They were rebuilt with materials taken from houses abandoned by the refugees. A remarkable architectural detail: on every floor, every crammed apartment has massive metal latticework fixed on the external part of its windows. There are as many grids on the façades of buildings as there are paraboloid antennas in a neighbourhood with no cable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Western part of the NKR is coming back to life. Only the tanks, displayed as monuments, and the profusion of military uniforms keep alive the memory of the frozen conflict. Our race in the renovated side of town, on the ‘North-South highway’ (also built by the Armenian Diaspora) ends in Vank, 45 km from Stepanakert. For the greatest part of the drive, it rained cats and dogs. We escape the flood near a hill peak when a ship appears in front of us. This is the <em>Eclectica </em>complex comprising a restaurant and a hotel. The owner is an eccentric Armenian businessman from Moscow who was born here. The building is supposed to be a replica of the Titanic, and the interior is a mixture of Greek statues and Impressionist replicas: Van Gogh’s heads, modelled in strident colours, hang on the walls of the dining hall. The owner had another eccentric initiative: he sponsored a mass wedding for almost 700 couples on the Stepanakert stadium in order to encourage birth rate. To everyone’s surprise, the NKR experienced a <em>baby boom</em> for which, however, <a href=\"http://www.armenia.com.au/news/Armenia-News/English/279/Karabakh-mass-wedding-results-in-baby-boom\">the local maternity hospital wasn’t at all prepared</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bus full of students arrives and the students photograph themselves around the Titanic which seems to be as popular as the Gandzasar monastery close by. Not long ago, the main attraction of <em>Eclectica</em> was the Chinese restaurant. Two chefs were brought from China and lodged in the village. Nevertheless, the business is shaky. The Chinese restaurant has been reduced to a photocopied menu on which the waitress circles the only food available:  boiled rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(597,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-02',NULL,NULL,'The frontline','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NKR (Nagorno-Karabakh Republic) has two faces, just like Two-Face, the villain in the <em>Batman</em> comic books. The war ended sixteen years ago; nobody moved into the villages inhabited by the Azerbaijani and the houses destroyed in the war were looted for building materials. The entire buffer area with Azerbaijan is kept in a sinister dereliction. Even nowadays, there are attacks on and off. From time to time, a soldier on one side or the other loses his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We covered the entire frontline from Martakert to Martuni. Most places we have been to don’t even exist on an Armenian map. They are simply gone. Neither the frontline, nor that of the NKR border is marked, but it can be easily identified by the trenches, using satellite images of Google maps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We requested a written authorization from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit settlements which do not appear on the Armenian map. We were denied access to several on the list, among which A?dam. And yet, if you want to reach a Northern or Eastern town, you have to pass by it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the conflict, A?dam numbered approximately 150.000 inhabitants. It was a flourishing commercial node. A?dam is currently a ghost town and a strategic military point. Whoever controls A?dam, controls the entire NKR region. The Azerbaijani army set up its main military base in the town and it was from here that it bombed the town inhabited by Armenians. Stepanakert suffered immense damage from Azeri bombardment for more than a year. A?dam was captured by Armenian forces in mid 1993 and, shortly after, the conflict ceased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever escaped military operations was hashed up real nice after the Azerbaijani left. The houses of A?dam were melted down and contributed to the reconstruction of Armenian houses destroyed during the bombardment. However, almost 300 people live in this ghost town. Some of them are shepherds who lead their cattle on the surrounding demined fields. Others make a living by collecting scrap metal from debris and the fields. On the side of the town’s main roads deep gutters bear witness to ample operations to dig up pipes and cables belonging to the old infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We passed by A?dam through the middle of a row of rusty tanks and carriers which seemed to have frozen in the field. There are neither inhabitants, nor signposts in the area, so we lost our way to Martakert. We went on a road we thought was the main one, among demined fields marked <a href=\"http://www.halotrust.org/\">Halo Trust</a>. On our right and left, we pass ghost villages: skeletons of houses, heaps of stones and tall weeds. In the middle of the field, next to a cluster of ramshackle houses, we see a chain dropped to the ground, a stop sign and a security booth. Not a soul around. I drive on and behind some fences I see a group of soldiers who were wrestling. I turn the car around, enter their courtyard and ask for directions. It instantly dawns on me that we’re lost. We come up against the NKR army who are guarding the positions in the trenches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They show us on the map that we’ve crossed the border line. The GPS shows we are very close to Terter and we also learn that Azerbaijani military forces have already set up camp. While we were all gesturing, an Armenian car comes up from behind. Another couple of stragglers. The soldiers turn an annoyed face to us. However, they agree to take a picture with us; then, their captain shows up and advises us on a very firm tone to drive back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We leave behind a dozen bare-chested soldiers wearing flip-flops, real jokesters to the bone – they don’t seem to sense real danger. And yet, hundreds of skirmishes between the two sides – which frequently violate cease-fire agreements – are reported monthly. The day after our wandering on the border, right in the same region, <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/Armenian_Azerbaijani_Clashes_Continue_In_Karabakh/2078581.html\">four Armenian soldiers and one Azerbaijani soldier</a> died in an intense overnight skirmish. The incident occurred just a few hours after the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan met for peace negotiations hosted by Dmitry Medvedev.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(634,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-04',NULL,NULL,'NKR: The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our expedition along the frontline between the NKR and Azerbaijan, passing by the ghost villages kept in ruins, what struck me was the lethargic state of those houses virtually razed to the ground and the surreal stillness surrounding them. A stillness which was twice interrupted: the first time by the radio searching in vain for any type of music until it managed to detect a station broadcasting in English: Abu Dhabi FM. The second time, not far from the frontline, an oasis of coloured roofs announced their presence through the deafening sounds of some strident music. Amidst that wilderness, we came across a sort of complex which is rented out for private parties: an L-shaped house, two covered terraces, several motel-like rooms and a swimming pool. At noon, a pack of teenagers in evening dress had just gotten the party started. They were celebrating a girl’s birthday; the birthday girl herself told us in English that wasn’t a restaurant, but we were welcome to join them. A middle-aged guy was filming the whole thing as if it were a wedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I felt the same wave of surprise wash over me when I met Lusine Musayelyan. Her exuberant optimism and fearlessness seem almost surrealist in the context of the situation in the region. Lusine is a journalist from Stepanakert, the only one to collaborate with the independent press of the NKR: <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net/programme/caucasus\">IWPR</a>, <a href=\"http://www.azatutyun.am/section/english/666.html\">Radio Free Europe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/\">Caucasian Knot</a>. She is 25 and her childhood was marked by the terror of war. Her father was actively engaged in the conflict and was killed in action. At the beginning of the ‘90s, Lusine lived and went to school in bunkers, under Azeri bombardment, for almost two years. Her sister was born in a hospital set up in a bunker. Lusine said she has had enough of the ongoing hate between Armenians and Azerbaijani; she also regretted not being allowed to visit Azerbaijan. Actually, no Armenian is allowed to. She has journalist friends in Azerbaijan whom she meets at various seminars in neutral countries such as Georgia or Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lusine believes the press in the NKR is nonexistent as it’s under complete government control. Nobody criticizes the local government and the manner in which public money is spent constitutes a military secret. She is very upset with the company which holds a monopoly over the only telephone and Internet network (Karabakh Telekom). An arranged contract allows the company (owned by an Armenian-Lebanese) to set very high prices and a lousy Internet connection. Lusine often has to work from the computers of a government centre for bloggers where the access is free, though you might have the surprise to find out you’re being tapped by the NKR National Security Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Armenian Diaspora regularly visits the region; a visit to Karabakh is similar to a Muslim’s pilgrimage to Mecca. However, very few decide to stay. In Shushi, ten kilometres from Stepanakert, we met an Armenian couple: he is a French Armenian from Marseille and she is a Romanian from Oradea. <a href=\"http://www.shoushi.nk.am/uk/ayl/contacts.htm\">Armen de Shoushi</a> met <a href=\"http://epigrammaton.blogspot.com/\">Cristina</a> on the Internet. Seven months ago he convinced her to move to the NKR where Armen has been living since 2004. The housing issue was solved a long time ago. When he settled here, the mayor told him to choose an apartment in one of the many, almost crumbling, buildings. He chose two apartments which he joined together, renovated and put up in international travel guides as accommodation (bed &amp; breakfast). He has the right to use the apartments for life, but he cannot sell them. The evening we went over to their house Cristina was eagerly waiting for her parents’ answer to the news she had sent them via e-mail: she and Armen are getting married.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(636,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-06',NULL,NULL,'Stepanakert, the NKR – Baku, Azerbaijan','<p><img title=\"_DSC8655\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/DSC8655.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p>The conflict over Karabakh has added mandatory routes to the Caucasian maze. We’re forced to go a long way around if we want to reach Baku. From Stepanakert, the direct road runs a bit over 350 kilometres; however, the only possible route passes through Georgia and is over 1.000-km long. We go around Lake Sevan, exit Armenia and enter Azerbaijan from Georgia through Krasny Most - the crossing point between Georgia and Azerbaijan. Two and a half days on the road, one night at a hotel and a few hours of sleep in the car somewhere on the side of the Azerbaijan main road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From afar, the entry into Azerbaijan seems quite impressive: heavily decorated huge stone gates which frame a brand new hi-tech space. Up close, I realize the crossing point is used only for trucks. The cars pass through a narrow funnel which ends in a large pit set up as a canal lock – a parking lot enclosed from both parts by a solid grating. The military officers grudgingly close and open the gates. Only 20 cars in front of us and the entry into Azerbaijan lasts three hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petru? has to walk all the way as passengers aren’t allowed in the car. Everything goes smoothly for him. He ends up waiting three hours under the scorching sun for me to pass through. Although the space is very narrow, limos and buses make their way through the long queue of cars. Each of them according to the connections the driver’s got with the officers and the size of his wallet. A very motley crowd of tradesmen wait among the cars, their vehicles overflowing with wicker baskets and bags full of hens. From time to time, the fowls manage an escape, leaving behind a cloud of dust and a short, but intense hunt. The tradesmen know one another and, although they’ve been waiting for hours in the sun, they seem to be having the best of times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In front of me, a swarthy taxi driver with a huge beer belly is feeling quite at home. He drives a dusty old Mercedes. Using his finger, he carefully wipes clean the logo and the inscription with the name of the car. For three whole hours I have the privilege of watching his habits. He socializes with the women vendors, he rubs shoulders with the soldiers, he makes a show every time he has to get off the fence in order to move his car, he loads and unloads packages into and from his spacious trunk. Although he’s from the region, he can’t butt in like other more well-heeled drivers. I didn’t see him the first time the line moved as he was chewing the rag in the shade; so I just get around his car left in the middle of the road. He quickly pops up in front of me, putting on a flabbergast face, after which he grumbles something and gives me a strong warning by pointing his finger at me. The next time the line advances, he sends one of his chat buddies to move his Mercedes. The long hours eventually get the better of him. We enter the canal lock almost at the same time and I realize that for all the cars, whether they’re going in or out, there is only one officer putting the stamps and processing the documents. In the continuous mêlée in front of the officer’s booth, the taxi driver blows his stack. He takes an elderly officer by the collar, gesticulates, yells and pushes two drivers. Next to him, two Azeri are mutually grabbing their collars, a fight they will continue in the officer’s office. Next to the gate one can hear a slap on another driver’s scruff. I manage to make my escape – along with my papers – from the Azeri chaos with the help of a young customs officer. He warns me that the Armenian visa will require I undergo an interrogatory with the other customs officers. However, nobody asked me anything about it. They were having their hands full with all the bribes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road – the so-called ‘highway’ – from the border to Baku spans around 500 km. In many places construction works are still going on, so we drive from the road onto the field. We have an interesting encounter with the Road Police who are robbing the drivers on the side of the road in brand new BMW limos. Ten minutes after we enter the country I am told to pull over. The policeman points to a table: apparently I exceeded the regulation speed by 20 km. He has no way of proving it though. He says I can get away with just 100 bucks. I act the fool and I finally get it through that thick skull of his that I don’t have any money and that I am waiting for him to write me the ticket. He, in his turn, tells me he will not return my papers. I tell him in English I will call the Embassy. I step away from the car for five minutes because he has other clients – Azeri drivers who come straight to him, bills in their hands, and then drive off. The policeman tries to convince Petru? we have to pay. He seems pretty embarrassed, pulls his helmet down his head and proceeds to vigorously pick his left nostril, then his right, gazing sheepishly into the distance. He’s probably thinking what he could do with a hundred bucks. He snaps out of his daydreaming and asks for 50 dollars. I refuse to pay up and add that Romania is friends with Azerbaijan, as is our president with Alyiev. In two minutes he gives me back the papers and beckons me to step on it. We had to make such ‘stops’ all the way to Baku; the bribe required decreased as we approached Baku until I only had to show them my ID. All in all, we managed to cross Azerbaijan without giving any bribe. In fact, the last policeman to stop me in Baku insisted he practice with me a complicated salute such as that of motorcyclists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(639,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-07',NULL,NULL,'Baku, Azerbaijan','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I made a short trip to Baku two years ago. The changes I’ve noticed this time around now are spectacular. Baku is a town which has had an incredible evolution: it has grown five times in the past 20 years and has an urban population estimated at three million people, almost half of the country’s population. From an image perspective, the funds from oil businesses (which are in the hands of the Alyiev clan) have worked wonders. The greater part of downtown Baku has been renovated, the building façades are lit up at night and works are still underway. Baku can safely compete with any capital in the West. Unfortunately, the monotony of renovations has melted away the local colour. Everything smells like new, but in a rather artificial way. The locals downtown have been evacuated and their place has been taken by members of the government. Besides, the renovations were done according to a strategy allowing the political clientele to keep cashing in public money. Just to give an example: the balconies of each building are being renovated in an identical manner. Regardless of the architecture of the building, they have been equipped with a wood cover, the same everywhere. It’s something similar to the useless street curbs which have swarmed Romania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most of the country is struggling with poverty, a privileged class living in the capital have set up their own little Switzerland downtown. Luxury cars cram on crowded boulevards. A visit to any supermarket is a source of utter stupor: local products are practically non-existent while most goods are imported and cost a fortune. All the brands on the shelves are top notch. Local journalists explained the situation: this is caused by the great monopoly held by politicians. The import of several categories of good is strictly under government control and thus, there is no competition whatsoever. It is common knowledge who controls tropical fruits, coffee, chocolate, meat etc. The control and personal benefits are organized in a pyramid scheme with the President at the top.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Azerbaijan produces over one million oil barrels per day. Add a considerable gas production and everything is turned to cash. Officially, about five and a half billion Euros is annually cashed in by the <a href=\"http://www.oilfund.az/en\">State Oil Fund</a> (an utterly hazy government structure) and then transferred to the country budget. Actually, this huge wealth is under the current president’s strict control, that is, Ilham Aliyev, the son of the Azeri nation’s father, Heydar Aliyev.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seven years ago, on his deathbed, Heydar Aliyev appointed his son as the sole presidential candidate. Aliyev Sr. became a member of the NKVD in 1944 and the head of Azerbaijani KGB in the ‘60s. Since 1969 he was the leader of Soviet Azerbaijani for almost 20 years. He was forced to resign from his position amidst the alleged corruption charges by Gorbachev.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He kept a low profile for several years and became the leader of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic as the Soviet Union was collapsing. His rise to power in Azerbaijan came next, using the armed conflict in Karabakh to his advantage. He was elected president in 1993 and ran the country as a real dictator until his death in 2003 when he appointed his son as his sole successor. Posters and pictures bearing his face infested the country. We have seen his face on press credentials or used as a logo on public television. The election of his son, Ilham, virulently criticized by human rights activists generated protests which were quickly and violently repressed. Great powers, such as the U.S.A. or the U.K., promote rather oscillatory politics by financing projects to consolidate the democracy in Azerbaijan and supporting investors such as British Petroleum or Chevron in order to have their hands on the biggest oil businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The common Azeri population does not benefit from the profit made by oil magnates. The American press has recently reported that Aliyev’s children own properties of almost 75 million dollars in Dubai. The youngest of the family (an 11-year-old boy) <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030405390.html\">owns over half of these properties</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(667,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-08',NULL,NULL,'Terrified journalists ','<p><img title=\"_DSC8720\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/DSC8720.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p>A few months ago we met journalist Agil Khalil in Milan, before an ample manifestation against organized crime. We crammed into the two-door car of some <a href=\"http://flarenetwork.org/\">FLARE</a> volunteers - co-organizers of the event - who took us from the airport to the hotel. Agil was invited as victim of organized crime, but, on the road, I didn’t have time to learn about the terrors he was subjected to before fleeing Azerbaijan. I only knew he had taken refuge in Paris in a <a href=\"http://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/fileadmin/rte/docs/2010/100618_Nothilfebericht_eng.pdf\">special location</a> for journalists such as himself. In Baku I had the chance to find out more about this young journalist’s adventure in Azerbaijan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all started the moment Agil accidentally came across an illegal logging business owned by the Secret Services. He wanted to write an article on it. For six months he was discredited in the government press, harassed by the Police, beaten, pushed from the platform in front of an oncoming subway train and stabbed in the chest. International organizations and the embassies in Baku intervened in favour of Agil and he was hired bodyguards in order to get him out of the country.  He had tried to flee the country several times, but he was turned around from the airport and the border with Georgia under various pretexts. In the end, after a <a href=\"http://azerireport.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=370&amp;Itemid=42\">dramatic night</a> spent in Baku Airport and after the intervention of the French and the U.S.A. embassies, Agil managed to get on a plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agil’s situation is representative for the manner in which the state acts with regard to the independent and critical press. <a href=\"http://www.osi.az/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2055&amp;Itemid=449\">Inconvenient journalists or bloggers have been assassinated, kidnapped and tortured</a>. Others made it alive, but <a href=\"http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/537869.php\">they were imprisoned</a> even for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aaecvg7xCIk\">having mocked</a> the corruption of their government leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emin Huseynov is running an <a href=\"http://www.irfs.az/\">NGO for the reporters’ safety</a> and freedom of expression. He was also brutally beaten, arrested, his equipment was destroyed; in addition, various state bodies make regular intimidating inspections at his office downtown. Emin is quite adamant: ‘There is no independent television or radio. Only two journals are resistance journals, but even they are partially controlled when certain pieces of information mustn’t be published’. Anyway, journals have a very low impact in Azerbaijan with a circulation of 5.000-10.000 copies. Moreover, according to Emin, the lack of a distribution network has lead to a circulation of only 1.000 copies outside the capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year the BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe (RFE) lost their broadcast licences in Azerbaijan. However, <a href=\"http://www.azadliq.org/\">RFE</a> still has its webpage where critical and independent materials can be read. The Internet is the only means of expression for independent press, though for how long is still a mystery because the government has already announced it will introduce licences and regulations for online media. Furthermore, the Azeri’s access to Internet is limited by the very high prices and a provider under government control. An independent news site rarely exceeds 2.000 unique visitors per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked what the taboo subjects in the Azerbaijan press are and we were given a list of all the profitable businesses belonging to the state: the Oil Fund, the SOCAR company, details regarding spending public money on constructions and infrastructure. The same goes for the Heydar Aliyev Foundation run by the president’s wife, a sort of a secret cabinet. Apparently Ilham Aliyev doesn’t take criticism too well: ‘If you criticize any member of the Aliyev clan, you risk being beaten on the street. If you write anything about the president’s wife, you will surely be beaten on the street’, Emin explains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a title=\"blocked::http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/freeAdnanHajizadaEminMilli/763595370/taf\" href=\"http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/freeAdnanHajizadaEminMilli/763595370/taf\">Here</a> one can sign a petition for the liberation of the two bloggers arrested for having posted a satire against the corruption of Azerbaijan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translation: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(670,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-08',NULL,NULL,'Sumgayit and the Absheron peninsula, Azerbaijan','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/24.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a driver, I have felt the same kamikaze atmosphere of Georgia here in Azerbaijan. Only one difference though: the people’s deafening mania for elaborate honks. The first time, I was startled by an ambulance siren and I instinctively pulled over. A jeep passed me up and the driver threw me a haughty look, clearly amused by the fright I felt. The honks frequently used are ambulance, police or fire engine sirens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went on a trip from Baku, along the Absheron peninsula towards Sumgayit. It’s true that a heavy oil stench persists along the promenade in downtown Baku, near the sea. The same goes for several places along the peninsula. However, we have found lots of popular beaches with clean seawater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important step towards a better image: most of the marine scaffolds which used to overrun Baku and the coast have been knocked down. There are still some around the town, but in more distant places. The earth on the field and among the houses is still overflowing with oil. Ecology isn’t a priority for those doing oil business in Azerbaijan. If one takes a look at <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/2085/\">the recent history</a> of British Petroleum, one of the main foreign players in the region, this doesn’t come as a surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although around 700.000 refugees from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh live in Azerbaijan, their houses aren’t as visible as those in Georgia. For political reasons, the government has tried to keep refugees in temporary establishments such as wagons or tents in order to constantly exert pressure over the NKR. However, after so many years, many of them have mingled in the throng around the main Azeri towns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in Sumgayit, the former petrochemical gem of the Soviet Union, that the Armenian – Azeri conflict broke out in 1988 when, according to official data, 26 Armenians were lynched and 6 Azeri lost their life in what the Armenians considered to be a pogrom. The huge scaffolds on the Sumgayit seashore have also disappeared. Only an immense, though rusty, industrial platform is still standing. The unbreathable air in the region is proof that one of the plants on the bank side is still being used. Although great efforts have been made to make the scenery friendlier, people aren’t exactly swarming the beaches which are far from being crowded, at least during the week. There are scarcely any terraces or restaurants on the seashore and those that do exist are mostly deserted. Perhaps that might be one of the reasons why the owners try to make good their loss (for the whole day) when they get their hands on a client. We have had the pleasure to experiment such ‘gimmicks’, otherwise representative for the Romanian seaside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody drives up to the seashore; on the beach there are beaten roads on which young men organize car races. Few women take a dip and most of them enter the water fully dressed or with a veil wrapped over their bathing suits. The beach is full of men on its most crowded section, the one near Sumgayit. Young or old, they’ve all left their girlfriends or wives at home and have come to the beach to play games or, when bored, to wrestle. <em>Mafia </em>is a highly appreciated board game and is, thus, very popular in Azerbaijan; there are even special separate booths to play it in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(675,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-12',NULL,NULL,'Ganja, Azerbaijan','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/15.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/25.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/34.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/51.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/61.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/71.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the roads of Karabakh, the clutch started to skid, slowly at first and then more and more violently. The roads up the mountains solved the problem. We drove on for another 1.500 km and, when we set out for Abkhazia from Baku, the clutch plate gave in for good. Those very ‘Christian’ curses laid upon us by poverty-ridden, frustrated intellectuals and zealots furious at us for not having posted anything about churches or monuments must have been effective. We briskly pulled over and ended up right in front of a car service. Well, it was actually a vulcanization workshop with a garage where the most popular car in the region, Jiguli, is usually fixed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I knew there was something wrong with the clutch so I had already prepared my speech in Russian. The mechanics turned the motor on all sides, nodded their heads and told us to have the car towed to Baku. We learn our car can be fixed at practically the same distance, but in Yevlakh, on our way to Georgia. We choose this option. A local brings out his Lada, procures some rope and we hit the road. 120 km on a road which turns into an earth road with holes on pretty large sections. The knots come undone, the rope breaks loose several times, so the distance between our cars keeps decreasing. The driver doing the towing takes up speed to 90/hour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Yevlakh we go from one service to the other – they only repair Ladas. The guy who towed our car cashes in his money and leaves. And here we are…in the limelight – the mechanics and their assistants from three auto services have gathered in the yard where the car has been shunt and everybody puts in his two cents. The verdict: we have to wait a few days until a new clutch plate is delivered from Baku. The biggest problem is that Russian is no longer spoken by everyone. We decide to ask them to facilitate the towing to Ganja. We negotiate the price with two military officers and finally reach an agreement. We don’t have much of a choice. The officer grabs the wheel and we use the same rope which comes undone twice on the way. We enter Gendzakh at rush hour, so I have to stand up from time to time to see if the rope still holds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we reach the car service, we calm down a bit: the yard is full of foreign cars, especially Mercedes. A professional mechanic gives the car a look and tells us to have some tea while we wait. It’s already afternoon. A stream of incomprehensible questions storms in on us. Ramiz, a portly guy, with a relic of a respectable mechanic’s belly and his serene gaze, joins our table. He’s an electronics engineer and has specialized in Moscow in computerized car diagnostics (mainly on Mercedes). He apologizes for his bad English and asks us what the hell we’re doing in Ganja. He loves the idea of a journey around the Black Sea and recounts his travels in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From here on, Ramiz becomes our protector. Calmly, but tenaciously, he gets involved in the repairing process, talks to the other mechanics, asks for opinions right and left. In the meantime, he gives us some fatherly advice; he’s amazed to find out we aren’t married, have no children and on a pretty authoritarian tone tells us to come to our senses. Upon hearing we have been to Armenia, he goes black in the face. He says the Armenians have been their enemies for centuries and proceeds to narrate in full detail how they massacred children and old people in the villages of Karabakh. Ganja is only a few tens of kilometres away from the conflict area and everybody here was active in the war. I ask him if they’ll ever make peace with the Armenians. Ramiz spent four years in the trenches. His answer: perhaps their children, but his generation surely not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The car cannot be fixed tonight. It’s already on the platform; the head mechanic says he needs help and promises the car will be ready on Saturday, that is, the following day. Saturday morning, after inviting us to tea, five mechanics convene around the Ford. They decide they do not have the necessary space to take the engine apart – they have no car lifting system, only the ‘traditional’ holes in the middle of the garage. Razim tells me he has already talked to a Turkish mechanic who has recently opened up a very well-equipped car service. The guy is waiting for us. The car is towed to the new service. The only problem is that the head mechanic is on his way back from Baku and will probably arrive sometime in the afternoon. There I am, alone with the owner of the car service and his friends who invite me to tea. The owner is Kurdish (former karate champion) and we manage to understand each other in a mix of Russian, Turkish and English. He says that if the car needs a new clutch plate, it might take four days for the piece to arrive from Baku, Tbilisi or even Turkey. Ford isn’t such a popular brand in Azerbaijan. After a three-hour conversation, his wife invites us to lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I and Petru? decide to go for a walk about town. The mechanic should be back around five. Our walk around the central square creates a great stir. Under Heydar Alyiev’s gaze from a huge billboard overlooking the centre, our Bermuda shorts get the youngsters giggling. From the terraces (which serve only tea) occupied solely by men, we are being reproved on quite a violent tone by an older man. Long pants are mandatory for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we return to the car service, the car has already been taken apart and the clutch plate rests on the table. To our surprise, Razim has come to see for himself how things are going. The plate has no streaks whatsoever and is as smooth as a baby’s skin. Everybody’s waiting for the mechanic who seems to be taking forever. We ask Razim if we can find a second-hand clutch plate in town. He makes some phone calls and gets in gear, so to speak. We must hurry as the shops will soon be closing. It’s Saturday evening. He stops a cab and we jump in it, used clutch plate in hand. On the way, he asks the cab driver which would be the best place to go. We end up at a shop of used pieces and from there we’re directed to a mechanic whose job is that of reconditioning clutch plates. The cab whirls into a huge yard with a row of garages, each garage specializing on one reconditioning operation. An interesting lesson on anti-consumerism. Nothing is thrown away, everything is reconditioned. The mechanic in charge of clutch plates detaches the used parts, takes the cast and cuts out new pieces which he rivets back on the plate. In half an hour we’re done: we have a brand new clutch plate. Razim is virtually beaming and seems happier than I am. No thanks are necessary, he says; it’s his duty to help if he can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After we return to the car service, we wait some more as the head mechanic needs to inspect the plate and assemble everything. The guy doesn’t reach Ganja until nightfall. In ten minutes we have the diagnostic: the clutch kit needs a few adjustments which can be made only the next day. Another night in Ganja. He promises we’ll be on our way to Georgia Sunday around noon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Razim encourages us: that’s life, don’t worry, everything will end well. He makes a sign towards the sky and I ask: In š?? All?h? He starts to laugh approvingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(691,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-13',NULL,NULL,'Abkhazia – First Round','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/16.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/26.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/35.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/43.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/52.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/62.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/72.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/81.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/91.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left the service snickering. Our car was ready in the afternoon. In Ganja we also wound up with a brand new rear view mirror, cut out from glass. Using a bit of scotch, we replaced the one which had fallen out when one of the mechanics put a little too much force into slamming the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As hard as our entry into Azerbaijan was, our exit proved to be far easier and faster. It was as if a vacuum cleaner had drawn us into Georgia. The red tape we had to wade through at the entry in Azerbaijan was quickly overcome by two sticky-fingered customs officers. One by one, they chose – as in a game of cards – several Azeri bills, the equivalent of 20 Euros. No explanation whatsoever. Just a big fat grin on their faces. The soldier who was this close to letting me through the metal gates separating Azerbaijan from Georgia was briefly distracted by a less ordinary conversation: a woman had entered the check-point area, shaking a black hen in one hand and rubbing a long dagger against the wall with the other. The woman was demanding the soldiers let her decapitate the fowl between the cars waiting at the check-point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We entered Georgia for the third time. Between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea there is no crossing point towards Russia for other citizens than those of the CIS. Caucasus has been transformed into an insurmountable wall. We were denied access to the international crossing point with Dagestan by the Russian officers who invoked the conflict in the region. An Azeri journalist pointed to me <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net/report-news/bridge-russia-costs-azeris-fortune\">an article outlining the difficulties</a> which even the locals incur when trying to cross the Russian-Azeri border.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tbilisi we pick up Vlad Lavrov, a Ukrainian journalist who liked the idea of taking a tour around the Black Sea and has thus decided to join us for the next two weeks. No more gesturing in Russian. Together we cover the Georgian sea of greenery towards Zugdidi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only possibility of driving further towards Russia is via Abkhazia, another separatist republic from the region. Abkhazia has been officially recognized by Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and other separatist states in the wake of the armed conflict with Georgia in August 2008. In order to enter Abkhazia, one needs to <a href=\"http://www.mfaabkhazia.org/en/mfa_chart/visa_to_abkhazia/\">apply online</a> and receive an official invitation which serves as an entrance permit. The visa itself is issued after entering the country. Travelling through Abkhazia towards or from Russia is considered illegal by the Georgian state. If your passport bears the stamp from the Russian-Abkhazian crossing point in Psou, you will be deported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only crossing point is the bridge over the Inguri  River, a few kilometres from Zugdidi. As the border with Abkhazia hasn’t officially been recognized, the Georgian state has not instituted a troop of border officers. It has, however, set up a police and an army check-point. The police question us relative to our intentions. A civilian, a gun on his belt, tells us we’re taking great risks if we cross the border as the territory is seething with corruption, ruffianism and lacks any Georgian control whatsoever. He even ventures to say that it’s very likely we’ll be denied access. He writes down our names and asks Vlad to write on behalf of us all that we willingly take the risk to travel in the separatist region. We finally cross the bridge getting round water-filled holes and local coming from Georgia. A huge revolver, hooked on a pole, aims at Abkhazia. Its barrel is twisted. The only cars allowed to pass are those of the U.N. or of international charity organizations. The scenery looks rather sinister – everything is dilapidated and inhabited by Abkhazi and Russian militaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our enthusiasm is suddenly cut short. A military solemnly announces we can cross the border only on foot as the official paper doesn’t specify the details of the car. Despite the fact that our application listed all those details. Moreover, Vlad doesn’t have an entry permit. Although the official site of the Abkhazi Ministry of Foreign states that Ukrainians do not need an entry permit to cross the border, the rules change during the game. We turn back, to the joy of the Georgian policeman who kindly advises us to sunbathe in Batumi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We regroup at a restaurant on the side of the road. As consequence of the frozen conflict between Georgia and Abkhazia, we cannot get through to any of the Abkhazia numbers we dial – mobile or otherwise –. Abkhazia has received new codes which Georgian networks do not officially recognize. At the central post office there is a special telephone (operators and everything) and we finally manage to talk to the consul in Abkhazia. Although this mess is entirely their fault, we are told we have to wait five more days to receive the necessary papers. However, we consider ourselves lucky to have been able to get in touch with anyone at all – the following day, the post office telephone is out of order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All we can do is have a nice, relaxing time in Zugdidi, a town with a unique, archaic charm. Only 30 km away, we discover a beach in the full swing of development, between Ganmukhuri and Anaklia. A mixture of military posts, folksy relaxation and modern infrastructure. The beach is glued to Abkhazia and was occupied two years ago by Russian and Abkhazi forces. To the south, right on the edge of the sea, we come across a modern and flamboyant construction imitating a fortress. Apparently, it is a pioneer camp and is currently accommodating children from Georgia and Belarus. Around noon, two helicopters overfly the beach and land in the camp yard. Two military officers armed to the teeth spring out of nowhere. The locals proudly inform us they are honoured to have an eminent guest: Mikheil Saak\'ashvili, the Georgian president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(707,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-13',NULL,NULL,'Zugdidi, Georgia – Sukhumi, Abkhazia ','<p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"04\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"05\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"06\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"07\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"08\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"09\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/101.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"11\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/111.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"12\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/121.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We received the necessary documents in Abkhazia when promised, not one day earlier. Last week, in Zugdidi, any person who learned of our intention to pass through Abkhazia made a point of telling us we were out of our minds as the region is a highly dangerous one. In the Gali District we were informed that, after crossing the Inguri River, there are scattered troops who collect customs taxes from passing tourists. Right before our departure, this piece of <a href=\"http://www.eng.ghn.ge/news-948.html\">news in the Georgian press</a> somewhat worried us: several members of the Georgian police were assaulted at dawn near the boundary line by some shooters hidden in the woods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We left at the break of dawn thinking that any dignified villain acts during the night and rests at dawn. We were briefed by the Georgian officials on the risks we would be running: villains, organized crime, gunshots, lack of any control whatsoever. Ten minutes later, on the other side of the road, the same soldiers who rejected us five days before seemed pretty impressed with our perseverance. The papers were all in order; in a few minutes all the ‘red tape’ we had to cut through (writing down our names and the car tag numbers in a maths notebook) was over. Leaning against a fence, an officer was just finishing his cigarette; he threw the stub on the ground, on a layer of stones and empty cartridges, some rusty, some brand new. Vlad informed him of what the Georgians had told us about this region and asked if everything was alright. A smile on his face, the officer assured us there was nothing to worry about. He paused in order to exhale the smoke, swayed back and forth and finally expressed his opinion on Georgians: nothing more than a bunch of faggots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The road from the border passes by the outskirts of Gali and reaches the bank side somewhere around Ochamchira. 30 kilometres of decaying road, huge holes and deserted villages. Still, Gali is an inhabited ghost town. It’s an utterly dismal region; the houses haven’t been totally destroyed, but everything is crumbling down. After the war ended, most of its inhabitants took refuge in Georgia. Any fence or sign post has been turned into a target and/or a sieve. This would be a perfect area to ambush goods transporters, but, except for local smugglers, nobody transports any goods in this region. Those who cross the border are locals of both sides who travel by bus. Otherwise, we came across army patrols, the police, many Spetstroi (the construction company of the Russian army) trucks and SUVs belonging to various international organizations. Abkhazi sources told us the area had seen quite a few armed fights between smugglers with one policeman killed and several people kidnapped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An unceasing informational war between Georgia and Abkhazia has been going on for a long time. The Internet has provided us with all kind of information putting both sides in a very bad light. Misinformation campaigns and the lack of local in-field journalists for both parties are taking their toll. Our trip through Zugdidi causes a lot of stir amongst the receptionists of the hotel in Sukhumi – everybody in Abkhazia knows that the Georgian side of the Inguri River is a dangerous zone for both Abkhazi and Russians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abkhazia stretches between the Psou River in the north and the Inguri  River in the south and historical documents attest to its having been inhabited by Abkhazi for over 2.000 years. In the past century, the Muslim Abkhazi emigrated to Turkey and the Greeks (who were a minority) were deported. In the times of the Soviet Union, a great part of the Georgian population (mostly Mingrelians) was made to settle in the area, so the Abkhazi population became a minority (20%) in its own country. The conflict between the Abkhazi and the Georgians violently broke out around mid-August in 1992. After breaking away from Georgia’s Soviet Union, the Abkhazi population wanted to declare its independence, but the Georgians showed little tolerance for minorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Georgian troops led by Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, quickly besieged Sukhumi and bombed the beaches from the helicopters. The Abkhazian government retreated in Gudauta, the centre of the separatist resistance. Backed up by Russia – Abkhazia was provided with massive logistic support – the Abkhazi troops succeeded in repelling the Georgian army to the other side of the Inguri  River. The war lasted one year, most of the battle being done in Sukhumi which was severely damaged by intense daily air strikes. Around 8.000 people died and 200.000 Georgians left their homes to take refuge in Georgia. A squad of Muslims from Caucasus led by Shamil Basayev, the Chechen militant, and several squads of Armenians joined the Abkhazi troops supported by Russian army. Less than a year later, the same forces found themselves on rival sides in Karabakh – Armenians and Russians against the Chechens who had come to support the Azeri. Abkhazia also had its share of atrocities committed by both parties. The Georgian army saw to the systematic and complete destruction of the History  Museum and the Central Library, especially anything that bore witness to historical Abkhazi attestation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We exited the Gali District taking the coast road in Ochamchira. On the outskirts, we stopped and talked to Nina, a pensioner who fishes alongside her daughter; nevertheless, the fishing they do isn’t for fun. Although Russia does pay the pensions of the Abkhazi who worked in the days of the Soviet Union, Nina’s papers aren’t in order, and, therefore, she doesn’t receive her pension (about 50 Euros). Nina complains the war destroyed any functional factory and there are no employment opportunities in the region. She advises Petru? not to waste any roll film on her and tells him to go to Sukhumi and take pictures of young female tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Abkhazi managed to conquer a territory which has functioned independently from Georgia for almost twenty years now. However, half the country is nothing more than wilderness and the rest has been turned into a cheap resort for the only tourists that do come in these parts – the Russians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><br />\r\n <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(713,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-15',NULL,NULL,'Sukhum, Abkhazia','<p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/011.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/031.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we reach Sukhumi, we quickly deal with the visa formalities. After presenting the invitation issued by the Abkhazi authorities and paying the visa fee at a downtown bank, we go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where in ten minutes’ time we are issued a visa printed on a separate sheet of paper, just like in <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/yerevan-%E2%80%93-stepanakert-nkr-585\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. As in the NKR, passing through Abkhazia leaves no trace in one’s passport, but the visa has to be shown when leaving Abkhazia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only 200.000 people live in Abkhazia and almost 80.000 in Sukhumi. The latter is an old, Russian town, organized on a regular grid, a former fort which was turned into a touristic resort in the days of Tsarist Russia. There is a very interesting blend of 19<sup>th</sup>-century buildings, Stalinist constructions and classic Communist apartment blocks in an exuberant scenery of sub-tropical vegetation. The oldest buildings on the bank side have been renovated, but most of the Sukhumi facades have been riddled with bullets. Hills covered by cypresses, palm trees, sycamores and lianas flow right into the sea. The gravelled beach is very narrow and stretches along the entire city, on the left and the right of the harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modern part of Sukhumi is a neighborhood of tall and crammed buildings; this was the most severely damaged area in the Georgian-Abkhazi conflict. It is situated next to the Gumuri River which marks both the city outskirts in the north and the initial border line between the Abkhazi and the Georgian forces. Many apartments are empty and have no windows; the doors, however, are all locked. Almost every building has a memorial plate bearing the names of the tenants that lost their life in the conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anaid is a journalist who works for one of the two weekly independent journals of Abkhazia. The journal she works for has four pages, only 1.000 copies are printed and lives of advertising. The editorial team – with the exception of Anaid – includes an occasional collaborator and the editor-in-chief. There are no other newspapers or magazines, mainly because there are only two printing presses. Until last year, all the newspapers of Abkhazia were printed at a single print press. On the eve of the presidential elections, the printing press was shut down. The two independent journals then began to be published on the <a href=\"http://era-abkhazia.org/news/smi/\">internet</a> in a PDF format. Not even the post office works in Abkhazia, a thing we learned for ourselves. One can send a postcard only from the post office in Sukhumi; the clerks there told us that all the letters are sent to Sochi, Russia where they are sorted and sent to the respective addresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anaid says there is no subject she can’t tackle, but, at the same time, there is no access to any sort of information. Not even the journalists working for government journals have access to information regarding the shareholders of companies or details regarding certain contracts, despite the legislation which regularizes access to information. Anaid’s paper wanted to investigate the case of the only bank in Gagra, a touristic resort on the border with Russia, which was said to be owned by the son of the governor of the National Bank. They sued the National Bank for not providing the information, they won two trials, they wrote about the case, but it was all in vain. They were, however, sued for slander by the National Bank and lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Anaid’s general attitude towards the government is rather critical, her opinion on the relations with Georgia runs along the same lines. She doesn’t travel to Georgia because she fears for her life. Moreover, she is a public figure and, therefore, needs a special pass from the government in order to cross the border. She believes she would get into trouble with the secret services and her visit would be perceived as a pact with the enemy and she would suffer great image problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Far from being enveloped in a typical war zone atmosphere, Sukhumi is a buoyant and colourful town.  A great segment of the beach south of the harbour is part of the <em>Sukhumi Sanatorium</em>, a complex owned by a Moscow army regiment. After paying a fee, one can gain access through a military check point. At the gate, we’re greeted by Lenin’s mosaic portrait, flanked by palm trees. Tens of pavilions and two high-rise buildings are occupied by Russian officers who have come on vacation with their family and are guarded by several tanks covered with the camouflage netting. The terraces on the bank side provide the fun part for the tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the evening draws on, the atmosphere quickly heats up. On such nights, the original songs have to be dubbed on the microphone by the DJ. As this is still a resting place, music is allowed only until midnight. So everybody gets down to business: the local wine flows in, whiskey bottles (from home) pop up on the tables, the officers invite their wives to dance and everybody is soon boogying on the dance floor. One dedication after the other and the dancers become ecstatic. The climax comes when a heavy military’s wife, dressed in white, emerges from the middle of the crowd, stretching and shaking her arms towards the sky in a long, high-pitched squeak. This resembles a scene from a Baptist church service when, amidst all the Hallelujah cries, the women enter a trance, thrilled by the music-filled pastor. In a short while, the music is turned off and the party breaks up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On our way home, in one of the open-air discos, we have the privilege to see a symbolic vision of war in full action. A portly woman with a boyish, pitch-black haircut, dressed in a vest reaching her knees, laden with medals and silvery stars who would easily put to the ground the Russian soldiers we have seen earlier, advances to the middle of the terrace. She raises a bunch of youngsters from the table and sits down for a short while. She breaks out in a violent brawl with the waitress who is trying to serve her. She goes to the bodyguard and the manager of the terrace to make a complaint – both men listen to her obediently. All eyes are on her. Then she turns to the DJ and forces him to change the music. Content with the new order of things, she returns to her table to have her drink in peace. Anyway, in twenty minutes the clock will strike midnight and the terrace will be closed. We eventually learned the woman was Esma Arshba, a veteran, the symbol of Abkhazi resistance. She fought in the ‘92 war and local legend has it that she managed to kidnap two Georgian soldiers and a tank, deeds for which she was heavily decorated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(718,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-16',NULL,NULL,'Sukhumi, Abkhazia – Sochi, Russia','<p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/012.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/022.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/032.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"04\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/041.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"06\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"07\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/071.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"08\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/081.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"09\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/091.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/102.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the only place in Abkhazia to have remained intact for twenty years since the collapse of the Soviet Union is one of Stalin’s chalets up in the mountains, on the bank of Lake Ritsa. This military unit and forbidden region, this complex - where Stalin came five times at most – was guarded by Russian troops until 1997 when it was handed over to the Abkhazi presidency. It has become a tourist attraction and the 40-kilometre mountain road is always flooded with tourists. Anyone can take a look at Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev’s bedrooms or the pool table and the Volga boat made especially for Stalin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourism is the key industry of Abkhazia. The GNP is unknown and the official annual budget is estimated at 100 de million dollars, a third of which is ensured by Russia as irredeemable help. The rest is covered by tourism and taxes. Russia has recently pledged a new 300-million-dollar irredeemable help – a favourite topic amongst old women chatting on the beach, hoping the money will be spent more wisely than that of their separatist neighbours in Southern Ossetia (apparently, they wasted the money on luxury cars and villas).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abkhazia is quickly approaching Russia which is welcoming it arms wide open. Sukhumi has already been included in the weather forecast (among other Russian cities) of the main news bulletin of the national Russian channel. Moreover, a train leaving the Abkhazi capital has been linked to the train heading to Moscow. The increasing Russian presence in Abkhazia and Russia’s acknowledgement of the separatist republic required a space for an embassy. On one of the main streets of downtown Sukhumi, a former hotel has been turned into the Russian Embassy and behind it, the Moscow Cultural Centre has been built, in a rather big building. Close to the new Russian constructions, the FSB (Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation) has its regional headquarters; the FSB marked its one-year anniversary (since its official presence in the area) by planting a small park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of Russian tourists increases from Sukhumi to the Russian border. And so do the prices. An official from Sochi has estimated that around 450.000 tourists a year cross the border with Abkhazia. Although the region is heavily mined, the <a href=\"http://www.halotrust.org/operational_areas/caucaus_balkans/georgia.aspx\">Halo Trust</a> has almost completely demined the area. Still, there are segments up in the mountains which are difficult to reach. The main resorts have been in the clear for some time now and the modern roads linking them are in an extremely good condition. Nevertheless, who cashes in the money for the infrastructure is a complete mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Near the route to Lake Ritsa, the road towards the most western point in Abkhazia (the Pitsunda resort) opens up. This is a peninsula covered by the same sub-tropical vegetation, flanked by a deep bay, with water as clear as that of a mountain river. Here and there, on the edge of the wood close to the sea, several high-rise buildings appear – hotels which haven’t been renovated in decades. Among them there are huge canteens – now derelict – which served the entire resort. The metal building of a lighthouse has begun to go rusty; now it serves as scenery as the new lighthouse is set on the terrace of one of the hotels. 30 metres at sea, a dolphin circles us for an entire hour, while Petru? is taking pictures underwater and befriends a Russian tourist who wants to mark the event properly. He invites him to a drink in the shade and asks for a friendship token: ‘davai ceas!’ (‘give me the watch’).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sprawling a few kilometres north of Pitsunda is the town of Gagra, the most popular resort in Abkhazia, glued to the Russian border. Judging by the car tags, tourists from all over Russia come to visit. From the terraces one can hear blasts of dedications for youngsters come from every corner of Caucasus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving Abkhazia is a much easier process than entering it; however, this doesn’t happen without an Abkhazi officer turning us around and asking for graft as he is actually doing us a favour by allowing us to exit towards Russia. Obviously, besides Russian tourists, this guy hasn’t seen any other foreigner cross his check-point as he doesn’t know what pretext to invent. He stutters a little, then blushes and, seeing we won’t give him a dime, returns our passports and lets us through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(734,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-19',NULL,NULL,'Sochi: the capital of a lost people ','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/27.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/36.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/44.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passage from the laid-back atmosphere in Abkhazia to the thriving and animate Russian district of Krasnodar is quite sudden. Even from the frontier point one can see the district is jam-packed: shops glued one to another, crammed cars in endless traffic jams and ongoing massive works on the infrastructure. As usual, the ubiquitous police forces keep a close watch over everything and anything. Hardly did we reach Adler when we saw on the left a huge billboard announcing extensive works to set up one of the many facilities where the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (OG) will take place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The narrow road winding up between the mountains and the sea cannot take in the army of tourists that keeps flooding in. Officially, in the Sochi region alone, about four and a half million tourists visit the Black Sea coast. The coast stretches along 300 kilometers north to Anapa and is strewn with tourist resorts which leads to traffic jams whatever the day, hour and weather may be. Vladimir Putin has promised the International Olympic Committee Russia would set aside 12 billion dollars for the infrastructure in order to ensure a proper development of the Olympic Games. However, Russian opposition politicians, among whom also <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/03/01/interview_boris_nemtsov\">a former prime-minister</a>, claim the money is wasted on games which will turn out to be a disaster because of corruption, organized crime and lack of snow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the infrastructure is just one of the many problems the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games raise. The Russian authorities are facing a situation similar to that of China in 2008 when the state was accused of the brutal breach of the Tibetans’ rights. And yet, the Chinese didn’t dare organize the Olympics in Tibet. The year and place of the inauguration of the Olympic Games, Krasnaya Polyana, mark 150 years since the first genocide in modern European history and the expulsion from their own country of <a href=\"http://www.circassianworld.com/new/headlines/1452-circassians-anger-at-sochi-games.html\">a people</a> who have been living in exile for generations. The people: the Circassians who were pushed to the Black Sea by the armies of Tsarist Russia in 1864, at the end of over a 100-year war to conquer Caucasus. The row of Russian forts between Sukhumi and Anapa, now turned into tourist resorts, prepared the defeat of the Circassian people: they cut off their connection to the sea and their trade and supply means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over one million Circassians were driven out by the Ottoman Empire in an operation strikingly similar to the massive Soviet deportations. Approximately 300.000 people drowned, died of hunger or illness on the beaches where they had taken refuge. Most of the survivors settled in Turkey, Jordan, Syria and Israel. Circassian families went so far as Bulgaria, Romania and Kosovo. Around five million Circassian live in the world and over 500.00 live in Krasnodar, Stavropol, Northern Ossetia and in three artificially-created republics: Adygea, Kabardino-Balkar and Karachay-Cherkess. Although they belong to the same people, they were separated, mixed with other nations and given a different name depending on the territory they lived on: Circassians, Kabardins, Shapsugs and Adyghe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I left Romania I didn’t know the first thing about the Circassians. It was in Ankara that I read about their <a href=\"http://www.circassianworld.com/new/component/content/article/1481.html\">protests</a> against the Sochi Olympic Games and I eventually discovered Oliver Bullough’s (British journalist) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Let-Our-Fame-Be-Great/dp/1846141419\">very recent book</a> which I used as my main source of documentation. Among the sources the book recommended there was a site of the Circassian community to which I turned to for contacts in Sochi. In less than half a day my message reached Ankara, Nalchik and made it back to Sochi. In the evening I met with the representatives of a local organization of Circassians and the following day we were fixed up in a nearby village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murat and Salikh are two thirty-year-old young men who were born in the Circassian villages around Sochi. They are part of HASE, an association set up by the Shapsug tribe. Murat works in marketing and Salikh in energy export. Both of them learned a false history in school: the history that mentions Circassians only in passing as people who existed once, but ‘left the table’ at a certain point. Salikh showed me old maps of Circassia, symbols, flags and pictures from commemorations, all of them saved on his mobile phone. He said the power of his people resides in everybody knowing by heart the history of their own family up to the seventh generation. He was very interested in the book I bought in Ankara, a book whose author (a foreigner) recounts in great detail Salikh’s very own history. I offered him the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian state’s reaction to this type of issues is much too fierce, especially in the area of the Caucasian republics. Therefore, the HASE organization doesn’t insist on the official recognition of the term ‘genocide’, but only that of the historical events that led to the deportation and death of the Circassian people. Moreover, they demand the symbols of the Circassian tribes that were exterminated in Sochi be included amongst the other Olympic Games emblems. Other groups from different regions <a href=\"http://www.circassianworld.com/new/general/1382-circassian-dimension-2014sochi-szhemukh.html\">have a much radical view on things</a>, requesting the cancellation of the Olympic Games or the establishment of the Circassian Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\"> </a><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(737,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-20',NULL,NULL,'Kalej','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/18.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/28.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/37.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/45.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/53.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/63.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/73.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"742\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexei, a tall, solid, blonde Russian young man, stands blindfolded with a black strip of cloth. A slender young Circassian woman, shorter than him, dressed in a golden traditional costume, is holding him delicately by the hand. Alexei is wearing a yellow T-shirt (bought from the bazaar on the beach) on which Lazarevsky, the name of the nearest resort, is written in capital letters. He is from Nizhny Novgorod and the young woman holding his hand was born in a Circassian village in the valley advancing from Lazarevsky towards the summits of Caucasus. The resort was named in honour of Mikhail Lazarev, the admiral of the army of Tsarist Russia, who headed the operations of annihilation of coastal Circassian villages 150 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two youngsters are holding the spotlight on the stage of a summer theatre. Alexei is the voluntary tourist, a bit out of place. The young Circassian woman is the one entertaining everyone with the dances of the evening. In the background, an idyllic painting photographically depicts a Circassian couple in a traditional costume, a horse, mountains, rivers and valleys. The audience are drinking and eating at 30 long, wooden tables. This is the village of Kalezh on the bank of the Ashe River and we are in one of the many thematic Circassian restaurants which, during the day, offer local wine and rotgut tasting and, in the evening, delight the tourists with shows, local dances and foods. In the Circassian villages between Sochi and Djubga there are tens of such places, cram-full with Russian tourists who go up into the mountains to take a break from sunbathing and the hustle and bustle of seaside resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We reached this place guided by Akhmet, a young man from HASE, the association of Circassians living on the Black Sea coast. The village of Kalezsh isn’t even on the local tourist map. It is called Krasno-Aleksandrovski 2 and is part of a series of three villages bearing the same name and three consecutive numbers, in honour of Tsar Alexander who ordered the deportation of the Circassian people. These are village which were repopulated in time and over 90% of them are currently inhabited by Circassians. Akhmet’s family too are in the business of organizing dinners and thematic shows for tourists. Sasha, his brother-in-law, cut down a peach orchard which produced three tons of fruit a year in order to build a restaurant-theatre that would feed and entertain 300 tourists an evening. In the past years, he has reached an average of one hundred tourists once every two evenings. As if in a village museum, Circassian objects are exhibited in a corner of the restaurant garden. He is very proud of the British musket barrel he found somewhere in the woods; he says Russian tourists are quite interested in the stories about the Circassians – a people they never knew existed and were never told about in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the villagers live off the tourists, even if this translates only into selling the fruits of their gardens on the seaside. Tens of uncovered jeeps and trucks, filled with tourists, plough the village streets and the valley of Ashe River. The tourists buy wine and chacha, a local type of moonshine, they take pictures of themselves dressed in the traditional costumes of highlanders and show a vivid interest in the local legends. Tourism firms and independent agents swarm the coast with coloured billboards offering complete packages in the Circassian valleys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sasha doesn’t expect to capitalize on the Olympic Games. The state hasn’t invested a dime in the infrastructure which would help the village and its inhabitants progress. Out of fifteen Circassian villages, only one is connected to gas supply pipelines; moreover, when getting off the coast road and going up the mountain, the telephone networks are no longer available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to the party scene, Alexei has gone off stage and so has the Circassian dancer. Their place has been taken by young tourists dancing on folk songs mixed with fast techno beats. What got them on stage was the invitation to dance for a group of Chechen children brought by the bus of a sanatorium to see the show. The girls (in bathing suits) in the audience let themselves go and combine Circassian dance steps with movements typical of a night at the club. A lank, blonde guy has had a bit too much of the local moonshine and is performing some amazing movements and then throws himself several times against the background as if wanting to break down the wall. The last throw shoots him straight to the centre of the stage where he giddily falls to the ground. One of his friends gets him back on his feet and leads him to their table. Behind him is the mixed crowd, joined by the Chechen children (boys only), dressed in T-shirts on which ‘Russia’ in written in capital letters. The children are under the supervision of a husky teacher, dressed in a flowered toile dress, a kerchief on her head, who dances along with them and admonishes them with a little red flag whenever they run amok. That lank guy has finally awoken from his drunken stupor and is trying to get back on stage. He wants to mingle with the Chechens, but the teacher grabs him by the collar like a kitten and pushes him away. In a short while, the music stops and the tourists are told they can take pictures with the Circassian dancers – for only 100 roubles. The Chechen children have warmed up and don’t feel like ending the party, but the teacher authoritatively aligns them in a column and gets them on the bus which quickly sets off. She starts to dance on the bus aisle to a vivid music, waving the same little red flag, in the applause and cheer of the children. Along with the departure of the Chechen bus, a cloud of dust rises above the village. At the same time, tens of jeeps, trucks and buses are taking the tourists back to the sea-coast. The show has come to an end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(749,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-21',NULL,NULL,'Looking for the Georgian glory','<p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/38.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/46.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><em>Vlad Lavrov, ukrainian journalist, traveled together with us from Tbilisi to Sevastopol.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><br />\r\n </em></p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>Back in the Soviet days, one of the most popular television series that had the entire country’s population glued to the TV screens was called Investigation Held by Experts (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigation_Held_by_ZnaToKi\">Sledstvie Vedut Znatoki</a>) , and told about a trio of highly skilled cops, who were able to solve any crime using their brainpower alone, without resorting to any violence. One of the most memorable episodes was about a group of dishonest art dealers who sold highly overpriced and often fake items. To expose their crimes, one of the cops went undercover, posing as a potential buyer. In order to win their trust he posed as a Georgian, who came from some unnamed Black Sea resort to Moscow to start an art collection having some funds to spend.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>This particular episode was filmed in 1979, when the average salary in the country was 120 roubles – 190 US dollars, according to the official exchange rate, or $ 24 according to the black market one. Yet, the cop turned Georgian immediately spends around 3000 roubles on a porcelain set and literally drives the entire art dealers’ community crazy demanding to buy the works by the famous Russian jeweler of French origin Peter Carl Faberge.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>Incredibly enough, the television cop didn’t need to get into the details of where exactly did he get the money to look convincing both to the dealers and to the viewers. All he had to do was to mention a private house on the sea coast, involvement in some fruit sales on the market – all speaking in Russian with thick Georgian accent.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>Unlike, so many instances of media propaganda, here the authors got the story right. In the Soviet Union, the Georgians occupied the vacant niche of wealthy people from the south that might resemble the way many Europeans and Americans nowadays view the wealthy Arabic Sheikhs. Andrey Epifantsev, APN publicist, closely following events on the Caucasus, puts it simply. “After the World War II, Georgia has become the darling of the Soviet Union – the first among the equals”.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>He points out that simple Soviet people who visited Georgia were very surprised by the Georgians’ prosperity. The republic could boast the highest per capita ownership of cars, and some of the best looking private houses in the country. There were two main reasons for this: Georgia’s geography with its climate perfect for growing exotic fruits and tourism industry. The other reason was certain leniency of the communist leaders towards Georgia. As the result, the first private businesses started there, long before it was legalized in late 80’s in the rest of the Soviet Union.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>I kept thinking about all this as we travelled Georgia. All the while, I was trying to find what has left of the old glory of that region. Yet, things are very different now, as despite the high GDP growth in recent year, Georgia is still one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>It won’t be an exaggeration to say that the old glory is gone. People are much poorer, their houses are shabbier, and the wages are lower than in most ex-USSR countries I have visited.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>However, for me as the traveler the loss of Georgia’s former glitz is definitely good news. As I look back at our Black Sea trip, I think that Georgian part of it was definitely the friendliest. It includes many things – from the local food, and the hotels to the way people on the streets were happy to be photographed and often asked for it. A friend of mine told me a story how visiting Georgia this winter, he met some local thugs, who wanted to rob him, but when they realized he was a tourist from Ukraine gave him some money instead.  Perhaps, this treatment of the visitors is a good substitute to Georgia’s elitist image of the Soviet times.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>After all, despite much easier and cheaper travel, travelling to Georgia back in the Soviet days was by no exaggeration once in a lifetime experience, unless a person belonged to the communist elite, or was a prominent artist, scientist or military. To say that you have spent you summer vacation is resorts like Batumi, Kobuleti, Tsqaltubo, just as in Abkhazian Sukhumi, was the sign of belonging to elite even in larger extent than to say that you have been to the most popular Russian resort Sochi. This meant that even if you managed to find a train or airplane ticket – always sold out during the season – getting accommodation at the resorts was nothing short of a miracle, and the stories how somebody did get lucky were passed in the families from one generation to another.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(758,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-22',NULL,NULL,'Kalezh – Novorossiysk, Russia','<p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/013.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/023.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We leave the overcrowded coast of Djubga in order to take a tour about Krasnodar. We head towards Novorossiysk and then we will be on our way out of Russia via Port Kavkaz. Unfortunately, technical problems regarding the car, visa and access into the Caucasian republics won’t allow us to stick to our initial plan: to travel through the Caucasian republics via Maykop, Armavir, Nalchik, Vladikavkaz, Grozny and Makhachkala on route M29, the Caucasus Highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loop we make through Krasnodar and back to Novorossiysk gives me somewhat of an idea regarding the prosperity of the region, a prosperity which ensues mainly from agriculture and tourism. On the way into Novorossiysk trucks with local tag numbers transporting cereals to the harbour stand in a 15-kilometre queue. As prosperous as the district of Krasnodar is, as poverty-stricken and touchy is the entire neighbouring region of the Caucasian republics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the deportation of the Circassians at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, this region hasn’t known one second of peace. After only sixty years, outflanked by the Bolshevik troops from Novorossiysk harbour, white Cossacks alongside the British army retreated in the same chaos and disarray. Soviet terror permeated the entire region. In the next years, hundreds of thousands of people were deported and millions were executed, tortured or imprisoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main charge of the Stalinist power against the deported people was the latter’s alleged involvement with Nazi troops. However, for quite some time, the Soviet government had actually been warring against the peasant or the thriving and independent highlander it wanted to force into collectivization. Some of them went up into the mountains and formed groups of partisans that questioned Soviet authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In mid world war, when any opposition force was in the trenches and on the front, Stalin and Beria planned the extermination of the Caucasian peoples in special operations secretly carried out. In November 1943, over 50.000 Soviet soldiers took part in the deportation of 70.000 Karachays towards Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Most of the deportees were old people, women and children. In December 1943, 90.000 Kalmyks and Buddhist nomads were deported to Siberia. In February 1944, over 450.000 of the Chechen and the Ingush people were deported to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. In March, 37.000 Balkars were deported to Kazakhstan and their history and name were erased even from the Soviet encyclopaedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half a year before, the Cherek Valley which was inhabited by Balkars, had been purged of the so-called ‘bandits’ by the Soviet troops. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Let-Our-Fame-Be-Great/dp/1846141419\"> Oliver Bullough’s book</a> records the December 1942 Sauty massacre when an entire village was wiped off the face of the earth. This special operation led to the butchering of 310 people (150 children and the rest old men and women) by the great Soviet soldiers. Meanwhile, the men who could have defended their families were laying down their life on the warfront for the Red Army. The documents that were subsequently brought to light indicate a much higher number: over 800 victims. As the region was a volatile frontline, during the massacre the Soviet troops were driven out by the Romanian soldiers who were fighting alongside the Germans in the Caucasus campaign. The Soviet propaganda blamed Romanian and German soldiers for the massacre of its own civilian population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deportations in the region finally came to an end in June 1949 when over 100.000 Greeks were seized in the middle of the night and deported to Asia from the Caucasian coasts around the Black Sea. Needless to say that during the deportation a great number of Greeks died as they had been locked up in train wagons and deprived of food and hygiene. Many families were separated for ever. Those who survived were settled in desert areas where they had to start from scratch, without any right to freely travel and under <a href=\"http://www.chechnyaadvocacy.org/history/From%20the%20Chechen%20people%20-%20MPohl.pdf\">the strict surveillance of the KGB</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting with 1956, a few years after Stalin’s death, the Caucasian peoples began to return to their native countries, despite the extreme red tape and state opposition. The process is carrying on even nowadays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union led to independence wars in every Caucasian region affected by deportation and indescribable crimes on both sides. Violence, bombardments and insecurity generated waves of thousands of refugees in the past twenty years. The locals view journalism or human rights activism equals a death sentence. This, together with special passes from the FSB which a journalist working in the area needs, keeps the media away from the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A news bulletin viewed in my hotel room in Sochi announced Putin’s recent visit to Nalchik for a summit of the leaders of the republics and local districts.

From Novorossiysk the congested road runs on until Anapa and then it becomes free of traffic. New, almost deserted roads head towards the Taman peninsula and Port Kavkaz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tourists and trucks are scarce. The crossing point is used by tradesmen and buses linking Russia to Ukraine and Moldova. Once every two hours, two ferryboats leave almost at the same time from Port Krym and Port Kavkaz. They have a very small capacity for vehicle transport – only eighteen cars and three buses can be crammed on the deck. That is why, although there are only twenty cars ahead of us, we have to wait five hours to board the ship. Behind us a very long queue forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the three buses on board is transporting sixty Russian soldiers to Yalta. The superior officers get off the overheated bus and cool down on the deck. They forbid the soldiers to come out and, for having the cheek to ask permission to get some air, promise them a nice cold shower right after they cross over to Ukraine. In Crimea, the Russian army still has an important naval base with the headquarters in Sevastopol. The contract allowing them to use Ukrainian territory for war ships is about to be terminated and former pro-West president Yushchenko had stated it wouldn’t be extended. However, the winner of the recent electoral battle was Yanukovych, a pro-Russia politician. Yanukovych quickly signed an agreement allowing the Russians use the military base for another 25 years. To the relief of many locals for whom this decision translates into preserving sure income sources and to the despair of pro-West Ukrainians who loathe the sight of Russian flags in Crimea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ukrainians have enough reasons to hate Russia. The Western part of Ukraine was decimated by deportations (100.000 Tartars and 70.000 Greeks only in Crimea) and the ‘32-‘33 Great Famine when over <a href=\"http://www.president.gov.ua/docs/Holodomor_English_version.pdf\">7 million peasants</a> who resisted forced collectivization died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ship we’re on pulls into shore and passengers who haven’t come by car huddle together on the deck in a state of tense expectancy. The connecting platform is slowly lowered, touches the dock and a group of sixty people darts at the passport control point. Everybody is tired of waiting and wants to be done with the formalities as soon as possible, which makes them throw themselves into a short, but intense race through the Ukrainian harbour. Some of them are carrying bulky luggage. A short young woman visibly stands out from the main platoon, though only to be outrun on the left flank by a middle-aged, white-haired man with a sunburnt face whose shirt is flowing behind. In a few minutes, the bored Russian soldiers join in the race. Why? As punishment for having requested permission to take some air on the float boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although our car is among the first to pass, we have to wait more than an hour to get to the check point. The other cars around us are transporting goods for sale to Ukraine and give the customs officers the regular bribe (huge packages). A customs officer gives us a form to fill in; we subsequently find out it was for nothing. We didn’t have to fill it in, but this way the customs officers can find out how much currency we have on us. A head of the check point, whose years of hard work in the country’s customs department have rewarded him with an impressive beer belly, approaches our car and takes a look at the forms. He sees how much money we’ve got and asks Vlad, our Ukrainian colleague, if we want a normal check or if we can make some kind of deal. In short: he wants bribe. He insists we might have forgotten to declare currency, medicine, alcohol or other goods. As we refuse to give him any bribe, he orders his subordinates to perform a thorough check. We unpack half of our luggage and one of the customs officers victoriously discovers the Tibilisuri cognac Petru? was given <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/tbilisi-vazut-de-petrut-553\">at a photo session</a> in downtown Tbilisi. Exasperated by the officers’ allusions, Vlad tells them we are journalists who have gone on a tour around the Black Sea. The moment coincides with Petru?’s luggage being ransacked. The customs officers regroup under some partitions and quietly discuss the matter with their husky boss. They return and, on a disappointed note and in a candied voice, let us know we can pack up and leave. They tell Vlad that our trip, which is the same as that of drugs dealers, is what triggered their professional check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(786,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-07-26',NULL,NULL,'Tartars (Sevastopol, Simferopol, Yalta, Sevastopol) ','<p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/015.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/025.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/07/034.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Sevastopol we’re going to take a tour of the southern point of Crimea via its capital, Simferopol, Alushta, Yalta and then we’re going back to Sevastopol. This is where the entire Tartar population (about 100.000 people) was deported to Uzbekistan in 1944. Although they were the first population to be deported, they were the last to be given permission to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 250.000 have returned to their birthplace in the past twenty years only to find their houses inhabited by Russians or Ukrainians. Most of these settlements were around the Black Sea, lands which are now considered extremely valuable due to tourism. These people have been fighting the state, the police, the Cossacks and private companies for twenty in order to reclaim their piece of land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhere before lunch, we enter downtown Simferopol where a handful of men, women and children are protesting with placards and sirens under the blazing sun. Passers-by don’t take heed of bald, bushy-bearded or long-moustached men dressed in white. Three policemen are indifferently watching them from the shade. The Tartars have resumed protests here as well as in Kiev. They’re asking for land, papers for the land they’re settling on and utilities. Nariman, a tall, bony-faced, chestnut-haired, green-eyed young man is our guide. He’s an activist in <a href=\"http://www.awdet.org/\">Awdet</a>, a Tartar organization. In addition to Russian, he also speaks a bit of German as he has worked in constructions in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narimar was born near Tashkent and arrived in Crimea in 1989. By 1990 his entire family had already sold everything they had in Uzbekistan and tried to settle near the Black Sea, in the area they had been deported from. Narimar says that at the beginning of the 1990s the Tartars tried to buy back their own properties. The money received for the houses in Uzbekistan was next to nothing as other deportees had also sold their properties – just like Narimar’s family – and returned to the Black Sea region. Moreover, in the context of the Tartars’ return, land price in Ukraine skyrocketed. The Tartars demanded the government give them land in the area they had been deported from. However, what the government offered them were lots hundreds of kilometres apart in a deserted and poor region of northern Crimea. The Tartars organized themselves and began a series of forced takings-over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Balaklovska neighbourhood, a military base of Simferopol was shut down. 42 hectares of land became available and the Tartars asked to be allotted a piece of land on which to build their houses. The government said there wasn’t any available land and tried to sell it to private companies. The Tartars occupied the land by force, fought with the police and fought off the company. The battle is still going on in the court rooms. Meanwhile, the Tartars have allotted land to 80 families and on each lot they have built adobe shelters – a four square-metre house with a roof and a door. These are the emblem of lands the Tartars in Crimea seized, they are a sort of Tartar squats. Entire fields around Simferopol and the 30-kilometre road to the seaside are packed with such constructions. Those with a good financial situation have begun to build actual houses, to plant orchards and move their entire family, even if they lack both the necessary title deeds and the utilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel Ametov, one of the leaders of the Tartar community has been charged with assault during the conflicts in Balaklovska. Narimar and I visited him in his house on the town’s outskirts where two new villages, Lugovoya and Stroganovka, have replaced the former deserted fields. Daniel built his house on a terrain occupied 20 years ago. He managed to also obtain the papers for the house. On average, obtaining title deeds lasts about 10-15 years. Daniel gives us a brief account of his family’s stormy history: ‘My great-grandfather was shot in 1919 when the Bolsheviks stormed into Crimea because he was an officer. In 1943, my grandfather was hanged in Simferopol by the Nazi army. My father was eight when in 1944, together with his eight brothers, was seized and deported to Uzbekistan.’ Out of nine brothers, five died in 1945. Daniel returned to Crimea and has become one of the leaders of his community – which is costing him a made-up lawsuit for assault: ‘I’m a Robin Hood, a Mandela of Crimea’ he says, a smile on his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narimar wants to show us one of the first settlements the Tartars took by force twenty years ago, near Alushta, a coast town. On our way there he points right and left to plains which the Tartars occupied and turned into villages. The topic turns to the Cossacks, the main factor of turmoil used by the local government against Tartars: ‘The Cossacks are mere actors, they do not see they are being manipulated’, Narimar tells me. In his opinion, there are no tensions whatsoever with the locals; the spirits are politically agitated around election periods. He even gives me an example: the government brought Cossacks to protest against the Tartars in one of the plains we have passed by, but the Cossacks quickly realized they could do with some land. According to Narimar, the Cossacks and the Tartars split the plain in two and occupied it together. Taking on the Tartar model, the Cossacks built little adobe houses which they’re still waiting to expand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Izobilne is five kilometres from the coast, near Alushta. Seif, his uncle, has a heavenly household on a hilltop. In the background, one can see the rocky peaks of Crimean mountains. His garden shields a valley covered by a vineyard and in the distance one can see the sea. Seif was imprisoned for three months because he had fought the police. Not to this day has he received any title deed, but, on the other hand, he has every necessary utility. Just like his neighbours, he makes a living out of tourism: he has turned his house into a boarding house. His yard is full of watermelons, peaches, apples and a lot of sycamores. Down the valley, near the seaside, he points to a yellow patch of land which will soon be occupied by the Tartars. Narimar, his nephew, is going to build his house there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(790,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-02',NULL,NULL,'Sevastopol – Zatoka, Ucraina ','<div><p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/03.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"04\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/04.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"05\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/05.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"06\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/06.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"07\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/07.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"08\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/08.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"09\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/09.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Crimeea am inregistrat zece mii de kilometri de cand am iesit din Romania. Am sarbatorit prompt, dupa obiceiul localnicilor, cu icre si vodca de la congelator. A doua zi ne-am pus la drum catre extremitatea vestica a peninsulei. In loc de reclame, soselele sunt impanzite de afise cu figura proaspatului presedinte Ianucovici, care tocmai si-a serbat ziua undeva langa Yalta. Sevastopol este un oras sub administrare speciala, direct de la Kiev, cu un guvernator numit. Dar restul peninsulei Crimeea are statut de republica autonoma si este guvernata de un parlament local – pro-rus, la fel ca presedintele Ianucovici.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ne-am indreptat catre Evpatoria, in ideea ca ne vom opri la Popovka, locul unde se desfasoara festivalul de muzica electronica <a href=\"http://www.kazantip.com/gallery\">kaZantip</a> – un “woodstock al estului” dupa cum se autopromoveaza. Este prea devreme insa. Toata lumea se pregateste pentru venirea petrecaretilor, se asteapta peste 150 de mii, dar actiunea se petrece in august abia. Vara asta kaZantip serbeaza 18 ani de cand exista ca festival. Noi am ajuns prea devreme, asa ca ne hotaram sa navigam mai departe, catre un alt punct care atrage o masa de turisti de alt gen: Zatoka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zatoka (fosta Bugaz) este situata la sud de Odesa, intre limanul format de Nistru si revarsarea ralului in Marea Neagra. Localitatea este o lunga limba de pamant pe care se inghesuie o statiune aglomerata. Este alterativa mai ieftina a plajelor din Crimeea, destinatie principala pentru turistii moldoveni, inca din perioada interbelica si mai ales din perioada sovietica. Atmosfera sovietica s-a pastrat pana in maduva complexurilor de la malul marii. O aglomerare pestrita de containere, garaje, bungalow-uri si casute de lemn se raspandesc printre complexuri serioase, foste sanatorii cu cantine care adapostesc sute de oameni. Nu numai cantinele amintesc de comunism, dar si sistemul de plata si prestari servicii. Plata se face toata in avans, la o casierie, ca sa nu poti aduce in discutie calitatea serviciilor. In fiecare zi pica lumina si apa de mai multe ori, in toata statiunea. Sunt momente in care multimea de angajati, care stau ciorchine pe coridoare si in curte, dispare fara urma. La fel fac si ingrijitoarele coridorului unde ne-am cazat noi, care ne-au dat pe inventar cu semnatura cele doua prosoape, canile, pernele si fata de masa de plastic. Insa apar prompt cand trebuie verificata plecarea noastra. Un bilet ca de liberare din penitenciar trebuie semnat de patru persoane diferite si e verificat de trei puncte de control ca sa pot scoate masina din parcare. Altfel veselie, tantari si o multime de turisti blonzi si rosii ca racii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O atractie la fel de populara este Primorsk (fosta Budachi), destinatie preferata pentru turistii moldoveni sau ucraineni cu buget foarte scazut. Este la cateva zeci de kilometri la sud de Zatoka. Afise cu oferte de cazare ieftina impanzesc stalpii si copacii in Chisinau, de unde vin cei mai multi clienti. Ambele statiuni sunt strabatute de autobuze care fac legatura directa cu principalele orase din Republica Moldova. In Primorsk, printre masinile cu numar de Moldova isi fac aparitia si masini romanesti, de la Galati.</p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(805,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-05',NULL,NULL,'Zatoka – Vylkove, Ukraine','<div><p><img title=\"01\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/011.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"02\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/021.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"03\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/031.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"04\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/041.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"05\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/051.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"06\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/061.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"07\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/071.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finally left behind us the beach of the Black Sea. But we weren’t done with the sea because we stopped for a few days in Vylkove: the Ukrainian attraction of the Danube Delta where tourism consists mainly of trips at the periphery of the Delta and through the town also known as ‘the Venice of Ukraine’. Despite its name, the town isn’t throbbing with tourists. The greatest numbers are those of foreign tourists who take one-day trips, boat and ship rides and indulge themselves in sturgeon steak and even caviar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘I cannot understand what they’re doing here. What is it they find so attractive here?’ Viacheslav says rather surprised while washing himself in the river. He is a young Ukrainian of Romanian origin who has worked in constructions in Western Europe for several years. Viacheslav, born in this region and settled in Vylkove, saw many hardships and had quite a few adventures until he could leave the region to work in the West. When he returned home, he saw the prices in the local markets (even for basic foods) had sky-rocketed because of tourists, especially foreign ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While taking a walk through the harbour, we came across the only Romanian speaking guide, a former teacher (on the verge of retirement) who is making a living from tourism. Mrs. Alexandra is from Izmail and had a great deal of stories and information she was willing to share with us in Romanian, so we decided to take her on as our tour guide for one hour. She’s got relatives on both sides of the Danube and she firmly believed our side is much poorer. Her stories were sprinkled with traces of state propaganda, among which the fact that Romania is responsible for all the bad things in the region, including the continuing destruction of the Delta, the increase of taxes and the expansion of waterways. Moreover, our guide seemed to be suffering from a rather aggressive nostalgia of the Soviet Union days. Apparently, everything was better then, the state took care of everything and there were no thefts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boat ride on the aquatic boulevards of the town opened our appetite for a ride on narrower canals, three times more than asphalt streets. One cannot gain access other than by means of special, narrow, flat-bottomed boats. We moved on endless, wooden walking boards to the racket of tiny dogs which guard every yard. Little reed and old adobe houses are fewer and fewer – apparently, decorating the walls with plastic wainscoting and installing double pane windows is what’s in now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this is a settlement of Lipovans, very few bearded men in their traditional costume can be seen on the streets. Even among their neighbours, all kind of myths regarding growing a beard circulate – the most idiotic being the one about Romanian Lipovans who would castrate themselves when turning thirty. At nightfall, a stream of young women in mini skirts and wearing high-heeled shoes begins to permeate downtown Vylkove. The central bar houses pool and ping-pong tables around a grandiose aquarium. Young couples are irritated at the army of mosquitoes which are intent on ruining a possible romantic evening. So, many focus their attention on drinking – one of the merry young men learns we’re from Romania and won’t let us leave before drowning us in kisses and hugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(814,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-09',NULL,NULL,'Vylkove – Chi?in?u (via Bolhrad, Komrat) ','<p>\r\n<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p>We left Ukraine via Bolhrad – Vulc?ne?ti. We decided not to pass through Transnistria on our way to Chi?in?u because we wanted<strong> </strong>to leave all our material in a safe place before heading towards Tiraspol.</p>\r\n<p>We covered the distance to Chi?in?u in a heartbeat because the infrastructure had visibly improved. We had a cup of coffee in an incredible construction in Komrat, the capital of Gagauzia. A two-level brand new wooden ship next to a swimming pool and a wedding salon decorated like King Arthur’s chamber.</p>\r\n<p>The last time I visited the Republic of Moldova was last August. At the time I had to get a visa which I was denied in Bucharest and I got in London. Before Voronin’s fall, the atmosphere was unbreathable; the secret services and the police harassed local and foreign journalists, businessmen and generally everyone trying to organize some kind of form of protest or resistance. The Republic of Moldova is obviously undergoing major changes. Even from the frontier check point we felt the Militia-like atmosphere had melted into thin air; the verification is done in a much more relaxed and civilized manner. Police cars have stopped obsessively patrolling the streets, chasing away youngsters who have gathered for a chat or to play the guitar – as it happened a year before.</p>\r\n<p>In Chi?in?u I tried to park the car in a paid parking lot I’d been using for years. The parking lot is still there, but the security service has been done away with. The same goes for other paid parking lots I knew. The thing is they don’t represent a business anymore. My car wasn’t stolen, though I had parked in front of the block we put up in. One of the myths about Chi?in?u – the minute you leave your car out of sight, it will be stolen – has officially been debunked. The massive <em>Raket</em> of the ‘90s has dissolved along with the dire poverty. However, the visible improvement of living standards has nothing to do with the political leaders of Chi?in?u. Actually, there is just one explanation: between 600.000 and one million Moldavians have been working for quite a few years abroad, bringing almost one billion dollars into the country (even in times of financial crisis). After passing through human trafficking networks, most of them work in the black market in miserable conditions. Not everyone enjoys the luxury of having a Romanian passport; despite this, they have managed to find work in the West. The rest of them work in Russia.</p>\r\n<p>This doesn’t mean the mafia is out of the picture. On the contrary, several important groups, ranging from oligarchs to organized crime, are just limbering up, especially now that the Voronin monopoly on any profitable businesses has come to an end.</p>\r\n<p>Last year’s change of power was so dramatic that the former opposition press surrendered almost unconditionally to the new government. The same mistake was made by Romanian journalists when Iliescu finally made it to the opposition party. In Chi?in?u, journalists and media NGOs have gladly accepted offices of spokesperson for the new ministers, of head of press bureaus or radio and public television director. The <em>Jurnal Tv </em>group, renowned for having resisted Voronin’s authoritarian regime, ended up owning a newly established obscure German firm (Rheinstein Media Management Germany) headed by a certain Tobias Radach, an amateur fireman and member of the local Christian-Democratic Party (somewhere near Frankfurt).

In the days of the communist regime, any inconvenient political move would be punished by attacking the finances of the respective politician: his own businesses or those of the sponsors were thoroughly investigated by every state institution. Pursuant to this relaxation, a new party emerged in the Republic of Moldova: the Social Political Movement of the Roma (MSPR).</p>\r\n<p>The party was registered this March and its leaders want to participate at the November anticipated elections everybody’s looking forward to. ‘We’ll get at least 4%, meaning we will have at least seven representatives’ Robert Cerari, the vice-president of the organization tells me, brimming over with confidence. ‘There are 250.000 Roma people in Moldova, though the officials recognize only 12.700. We will prove how many of us there really are. We no longer wish to complain.’ The MSPR have stated their number has already reached 7.000 members. Although most Moldavian Roma go work only in Russia, they have the same problems as the Romanian Roma: no legal papers, lack of official statistics, discrimination by the press and authorities and so on and so forth.</p>\r\n<p>Cerari, the proud owner of a black BMW with a Tiraspol plate, showed us his house in Soroca while explaining his monetary sources: ‘I do <em>bizniz</em>: my main business is with cereals, but I also run several stores and a restaurant.’ The hill rising above Soroca is famous for the Roma’s palaces. For many years now, Soroca has been seeing a cutting competition as to who owns the biggest house and whose house has the most freakish architecture. A while ago, the town hall complained the Roma do not pay taxes on the respective houses and that they are way over their heads in debt. Cerari claims the town hall increased taxes twenty-eight times for houses covering over 200 sq.m. only to sneer at the Roma who, in turn, sued the town hall and won. I remember that, at the time, Artur Cerari, the baron of the Roma of Soroca, said that the town hall should be the one paying them a tax because the palaces at the top of the hill are the touristic attraction of the town. And, truth be told, the houses do have a rather high touristic potential.</p>\r\n<p>Our guide is George, Robert Cerari’s son, a high-school student who wants to major in Law, in Chi?in?u. He proudly takes us to ‘the house on the 50-dollar bill’ which bears the initials of the owner (right on the top of the dome). He adds that the owner works in constructions in Russia and hasn’t had money to finish the house; he just fenced it in and went back to work. The guy doesn’t seem to fear thieves: he left a whole bunch of materials and statues on view. ‘Nobody steals around here. And even if they do, we settle the issue among us. We don’t get the cops involved.’ Next on the list is George’s uncle’s house or the house of Artur, the baron. The yard houses two steel-plated Volga limos (covered by a bunch of carpets), now lying in utter dereliction. We move on to ‘the house of the horses’ and we pay a visit to the neighbourhood fortune teller, surrounded by an army of garden figurines, some poker machines on the porch and, on the line, the object of her work: a fortune machine, just like the ones in amusement parks, where the client insert his palm into a niche and receives a ticket on which a computer has imprinted several observations regarding the client’s future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Translator: <a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron%20Alina-Olimpia.doc\" target=\"_blank\">ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(861,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-11',NULL,NULL,'Veteranii din Republica Moldova','<p>\r\n<p><img title=\"veterani\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/veterani.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Zaharia Sclifos was one of the first combatants to have crossed the Dniester on ice and attacked the separatists’ position on March 1<sup>st </sup>1992, one day before the official date marking the beginning of the war between the Republic of Moldova and the Tiraspol separatists. The armed conflicts had been on and off ever since the end of 1989. The Dniester war cost 400 soldiers and 350 civilians their lives.</p>\r\n<p>Zaharia was part of the <em>R?ze?ii</em> (<em>Yeomen</em>) group and, together with other volunteers, attacked the commissary of Dub?sari where they found enough ammunition to help them assail – also benefitting from the support of the OMON troops of Moldova – a Transnistrian military unit. It was a dirty war, full of diversions, in which an army of voluntary combatants equipped with little ammunition tried to vanquish the Transnistrian troops and the Russian professionals of the 14<sup>th</sup> Army, led by General Alexander Lebed. ‘At night we would kidnap Transnistrian soldiers and deliver them in exchange for our prisoners. The separatists used snipers whose equipment was fit for night vision. The only things we had were revolvers and batons’, Zaharia tells me in a small apartment in Chi?in?u. His house in Dub?sari was destroyed and he cannot go back there.</p>\r\n<p>Since the end of the war, the former combatants have continuously been on the verge of conflicts. One of the reasons is the still unresolved accommodation issue; another would be the conflict with the Communist authorities. In time, having a combatant certificate turned out to be quite a business: if you had connections, you could receive various facilities from the state such as a house, a business space, etc. This situation is a clear counterpart of the revolutionary certificates of Romania. 64.000 combatant certificates were issued. After successive investigations, only 34.000 were found to be valid. However, the number of those who actually fought on the front does not exceed 15.000. Zaharia gives me the names of several fake combatants who turned even to Gigi Becali to receive financial aid.</p>\r\n<p>The veterans received a block of flats in Chi?in?u, a block for which they had to fight the police – the Ministry of Interior wanted to take possession of half the block for its own employees. They managed to get rid of the police and get another block downtown. The building had just been refinished to accommodate Moldovan MPs. The veterans of Transnistria barricaded themselves in the MPs’ apartments and haven’t left it since. Zaharia works both as a taxi driver and a builder. He, his wife and their two little children live in a crammed apartment which also serves as a temporary shelter for a poet who usually sleeps on an improvised bed of pallets. He complains the state doesn’t take care of its veterans; when discussing his views on politicians and political leaders, the words <em>cunts</em> and <em>fuckers </em>keep popping up every two sentences. He describes the war situations in very harsh words, even in the presence of the children playing Counterstrike on the computer. He interrupts the youngest and asks him to recite some patriotic poems which burnt into my brain a sequence of quite unpleasant situations for potential invaders, best defined by the poems’ words: <em>wire, snout, pig</em> linked to <em>Hungarian, Russian, staple </em>and<em> dead</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Alexandru Ganenco, the commander of Zaharia and of the groups which fought from Dub?sari to the North, in Camenca, provides an overview of the hostilities and of the reasons for which Moldova lost the war. Ganenco is a colonel in reserve and led the anti-terrorism troops of the Ministry of State Security (in the days of the Druc government). Firstly, he cannot understand why Igor Smirnov, the Tiraspol separatists’ leader, was freed by the Moldovan authorities immediately after he was arrested and kidnapped from Kiev. ‘Our plan was to cut the Transnistrian territory in half in the Dub?sari region and to afterwards enter Tiraspol from the north. Everything was set, we had people behind the lines and we had also reached an agreement with the Ukrainians.’ Nevertheless, a rather suspicious order from high up cancelled this strategic plan and, instead, they were ordered to attack Tighinei, now called Bender. ‘It was a complete disaster as we weren’t ready for such a war.’ Another freakishness of war: ‘we would capture Cossack mercenaries from all over Russia and, two days after having delivered them over to the Ministry of Interior, we’d capture them again. Somebody was obviously freeing them.’</p>\r\n<p>Tudor Iovu, perhaps the only photographer to have worked on both sides of the frontline and to have published <a href=\"http://www.transnistria.md/upload/t_iovu.pdf\">an album dedicated to the conflict</a>, feels Moldova lost the war on an informational level. Tudor was working as photojournalist for Reuters and would be allowed to do materials for the press agency even from the Transnistrian part. In Tiraspol he would be welcomed with brochures, literature, pictures; he would even have a full escort accompany him and would be told all kind of stories about the atrocities the Moldovans had presumably committed. The relationship with the press was handled by Russian army specialists in the information field. There was no press centre whatsoever on the Moldovan side. Tudor would help his foreign colleagues by accommodating them in his house, find them food and guide them on the frontline.</p>\r\n<p>The Transnistrian conflict ended as absurdly as it had begun and unfolded. Generalul Ion Costa?, Minister of Interior and Defence during the conflict, has recently declared in a <a href=\"http://www.jurnaltv.md/ro/news/acord-moldo-rus-nerespectat-ii-125721/\">TV programme </a> that the person to have led the peace negotiations which ultimately resulted in a written agreement was Boris Birshtein, a Russian oligarch and businessmen accused by the international press of having connections with Moscow Mafia organizations and being subservient to the structures of the former KGB.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(865,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-16',NULL,NULL,'Pridnestrovskaya Moldavskaya Respublika (PMR)','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time I visited Transnistria was in 2003 and even then, to Moldovan journalists, the region was a black hole, full of legends and horror stories. I usually worked incognito, because journalist accreditation has to go through the Ministry of Security and I had run a very thorough research on the <a href=\"http://www.crji.org/folder.php?id=7&amp;l=1\">situation in Transnistria</a> a few years before. The accusations of organized crime, gunrunning and cigarette trafficking against the clan around president Smirnov’s family have never been fully investigated by international bodies which did order a thorough monitoring of the region, though they didn’t seem capable of carrying out an efficient research. Transnistrian Secret Services are constantly keeping critical press at bay, with countless journalists being retained in sensitive regions such as the vicinity of plants accused of producing ammunition subunits or  that of the Cobasna ammunition depot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no independent press in Transnistria. Two journalists are being held under arrest after having been charged with espionage, while human rights activists have been beaten or harassed by the police and politicians have been assassinated. The political stage is an ongoing masquerade where democracy and political diversity are constantly being mimed. Igor Smirnov has been president for twenty years now. The PMR is still active only because of the presence of pacifying Russian troops which were ‘christened’ by Mihai Ghimpu, Moldova’s acting president, as an ‘occupation army’ illegally stationing in the Republic of Moldova. No international treaty in effect has been able to remove the troops; as for the interest of the international community in this matter, it is right down non-existent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 800 combatants and civilians on the left side of the Dniester died in the war with Moldova. Of all the separatist republics around the Black Sea, Transnistria is the only one without any ethnic or historical motivation for creating an independent state. The leaders of the separatist movement were all born in various remote Russian regions; even president Smirnov popped into the world somewhere around Kamchatka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other notorious individuals sent from Russia to take care of the Transnistria issue is General Alexander Lebed who distinguished himself in the conflicts in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. He organized the defence of Transnistrian troops at the command of the 14<sup>th </sup>Army, currently known as ‘the pacifying army’. Vladimir Antyufeyev, the one to have established the Transnistrian Secret Service (MGB), also reached Tiraspol in those tumultuous days. Antyufeyev was fleeing from an Interpol arrest warrant, after having attempted a <em>coup d\'état</em> in Riga, Latvia, as head of the local OMON troops. Antyufeyev is still head of the Transnistrian Secret Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Transnistrian territory seems deserted. Although there aren’t any plausible statistic numbers, about 500.000 of the population works in Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. During our tour about the country, the only live beings extremely present and active were the Militia who tried a number of times to ease us of our money under various pretexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON </a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(874,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-08-17',NULL,NULL,'Break','<p><img title=\"53 - pauza\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/08/53-pauza.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p>Our 80-day journey has come to an end. We travelled 13.000 kilometres, crossed 11 countries (including the separatist republics) and written 53 posts. Our blog will be taking a break now. We’ll be back with materials from Romania and Bulgaria in autumn when Ioana Hodoiu will take my place as I <a href=\"http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/newsitem.aspx?id=100137\">am heading off on a scholarship</a>. We’ll also write some press materials and we’ll correct the mistakes which had seeped into the on-line journal because of my hurry and ignorance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The comments section was full of flaming opinions regarding the hacking of the Romanian language, triggered by the names of Caucasian towns. It’s funny to see so much surety and passion in those foreign to the region. The correct spelling of a town’s name is highly disputed even by the locals themselves. Only for Sukhumi there are 30 variations in spelling, each similar to a political statement recognizing an interpretation of the town’s history. My objective wasn’t to write a diploma paper on changes in town names, so I decided to transliterate from Russian one of the ways the name is written on the entry plates into town or to use the name on the English map. As regards comments about words ‘which do not exist in Romanian’, I can only say that, fortunately, the Romanian tongue is very dynamic – otherwise, I would have had to express myself via countless combinations of cheese, cabbage, badger and colt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I have met many journalists in the region, we will try to write several materials together which will be published either here or on the <a href=\"http://www.crji.org/\">CRJI</a> site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We managed to travel through the countries around the Black Sea without our car being stolen, without falling prey to rakets or without being bamboozled – as we had been warned so often during our trip. However, the most important thing is that not once did we pay anything to the road police, the customs officers or the border guards (except in Transnistria where, out of 10 verifications in a day and a half, we gave in to one and paid a 20-dollar ticket for a fabrication).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After returning home, people kept asking me about differences and similarities with Romania. Regarding major differences, at least on the bank of the Black Sea, nowhere else have I found that mixed atmosphere of swindle, disgust, repugnance and arrogance that crawls up on me every time I make the mistake of visiting the Romanian seaside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major difference is that, except for Romania and Bulgaria, every country is basically an open wound, bearing the deep marks of recent armed conflicts. Even Turkey in relation to the issue of the Kurds. Colleagues my age studied in improvised schools, in bunkers and have lost friends and family in such conflicts; their parents and grandparents were arrested, deported or executed. The region is similar to the Balkans’ situation of the ‘90s, but at a much larger scale and with conflicts spanning over the past hundred years, with abuses and events of an unthinkable cruelty. The international community has had absolutely no firm reaction whatsoever, much less an efficient strategy to mend things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important similarity would be the general virulent tone against primitive politicians. The simple folks I talked to, no matter their country or religion, expressed their utter disgust against their own politicians and the belief that foreigners see them as barbaric only because of the latter’s politicians and leaders. Moreover, interethnic conflicts that break out on and off are caused, first and foremost, by mystifications and manipulations for political purposes. Dictatorship, ultra-nationalism and religious zealotry have done the most harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None of these countries needs a redeeming leader. An excellent infrastructure, no visas and a free media are the only tools necessary for things to improve instantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(895,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-09-21',NULL,NULL,'The taxi driver and the beautician dixit!','<p>\r\n<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p>Two days before the departure, Petru? was sitting absent-mindedly on the back seat of a taxi when, out of the blue, the taxi driver started to sing the praises of the Bulgarian seaside by saying that he had spent a week there, that he had stuffed himself like a pig 24/7, that the breakfast had consisted of: seven types of cheeses, eggs (boiled, omelette and sunny side up), bread: white, brown, mulatto, toast; salamis, ham and sausages; tomatoes, cucumbers, honey, milk, tea, chicken and pork Vienna sausages, etc. That hardly would he roll ‘off’ the table and get to the beach that the guys at the hotel would clear the wedding tables in a jiffy and replace the wedding dishes with: fish, minced meatballs sour soup, chicken drumsticks, eggplant and tomato salad, meat pie, vegetable soup, Wiener schnitzel and whatnot. While reciting his culinary orgy on Bulgarian lands, the taxi driver contentedly ‘caressed’ his belly and said: ‘I put on eleven pounds!’</p>\r\n<p>On the same day, around noon, my beautician, her face tight and tanned to a T, tore herself from her focused silence and told me: ‘I went to the Bulgarian seaside. They’re light-years away from us. The hotel room was very spacious! It was actually huge. They changed our towels daily. Food and drinks non-stop and plus, for the money we paid (200 Euros for the entire stay), we could bring our twelve-year old child for free! Now tell me: where can you find this in Romania?’</p>\r\n<p>Exactly. Where DO you find it?</p>\r\n<p>Having had our curiosity piqued, we got into our Dacia Logan and cheerfully set off for Albena, this Mecca of taxi drivers and beauticians. However, the semi-deserted, cliffy beaches, the nauseating heat, a few archaeological sites that will cost you a pretty penny and an oyster farm highly recommended by my gourmand friends which turned out to be rubbish, will wear you down until you reach your destination.</p>\r\n<p>I have to admit that I am quite familiar with the Bulgarian seaside. A few years ago, I drove along the shore line until I reached the Turkish border. No strict or clear-cut schedule or route, only boisterous curiosity. That’s when I happened to drive on every strip of land leading towards the sea and on every roundabout seaside village roads. Last time it was much more fun. After the last experience, I’ve learned to tone down this curiosity of testing beaten roads that randomly open from the main road. Honestly, they don’t lead anywhere. Despite their discreet charm of paths that might be hiding something, at the end there’s nothing more than cliffs, dry grass, wasps and a gluey heat which is magically ‘washed’ by the breeze in Turkey, but not by the one in Bulgaria.</p>\r\n<p>The Bulgarian seaside is truly awesome when you enter and exit it. The shore line begins at Durankulak, a village only ten kilometres from Vama Veche and ends at Sinemorets, only ten kilometres from Turkey. Durankulak boasts of a wonderful beach, with fine sand and very few people, a shaded place where you can have coffee and cold beer and a restaurant where, the word goes, the food is great. I haven’t tried it, so I actually cannot tell you, but just the sight of it made me want to sunbathe. As far as Sinemorets goes, the place the Petru? and ?tefan mistook for Chernomorets in spring, where they ‘got served’ with an out-of-season, very expensive and odd-looking dish – so, Sinemorets is a nice exit: a strip of beach between the lake and the sea, with cliffs and sea as far as the eye can see.</p>\r\n<p>Ask a Bulgarian what’s there to visit at the seaside and he’ll proudly tell you (this has been checked several times) you mustn’t miss the inhabited caves of Kamen Bryag, the cliffy region between Shabla and Kavarna, that gives onto the sea. If you ask me, I’d say you can avoid them altogether. The Bulgarians’ version of it: ‘primitive Aeneolithic establishments, Thracian graves and remains of Roman and Byzantine civilization’; my version: boulders rising out of the sea and a bunch of small rock caves where, from time to time, hippies who communicate with their ancestors sleep under the stars. Anyway, visiting these sights costs five leva per person (the fee paid to visit an archaeological site). A few years ago, when I reached this place under the guidance of some Bulgarians, you didn’t have to pay a fee to visit it and you could camp anywhere you wanted. From those tall cliffs you could see here and there metallic crosses erected for very young people. As Bulgarians don’t speak a word of English, they told us (in a few words and a lot of gestures) that this is a place ‘beloved’ by youngsters who commit suicide out of love. The truth, however, is another: these cliffs attract extreme sports fans who jump into the water from 32-40 feet.</p>\r\n<p>Starving and with high expectations, we finally reached Dalboka. The place is obviously to the liking of Romanian since the menu also provides a Romanian translation of the dishes. For four years I have been hearing about this oyster farm. Each summer, my gourmand friends go to Dalboka. Why? For the resemblance with Greece and for the fresh oysters cooked so well they make your mouth water...NOT. The place does have a picturesque look and it’s good to have a cold spritzer, but food-wise, my experience in Dalboka was beyond lamentable: cheap hypermarket caviar in HORECA buckets, where you can barely fish two grains and oysters swamped in synthetic dressings with several flavours, probably purchased in huge quantities from the same hypermarkets. Nothing more than a cheap and awful fast-food, but with a seaside view.</p>\r\n<p>Only a few rutted roads (lacking any signs whatsoever) and a depressing wandering through the city of Burgas, which engulfs you like a black hole (without any drains). But about this and much more, next time.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(897,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-09-22',NULL,NULL,'Industrial tourism from Albena to Primorsko, Bulgaria','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minute we entered Albena, a feeling of nostalgia bringing memories of my childhood by the seaside seized me. Carriages drawn by horses with bells and red cuffs, tandem bicycles, coloured mini trains carrying tanned children, old-fashioned music, cotton candy, miniature golf, slides and lady bug rides. The parking lots were filled with cars with Romanian tags, the hotels reminded me of Eforie, the alleys of Neptun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this triggered an extraordinary return to the days of my childhood, so I desperately wanted us to spend the night in Albena. However, that wasn’t possible. Although the general atmosphere in the resort and on the beach was peaceful and airy, the hotels were packed with tourists. Armed with patience, we went to every hotel displaying ‘80s architecture and over-crowded parking lots. Not one single room was available. A salty breeze came from the sea, bearing a high SPF sunscreen smell which made one want to get down on the sand. We, however, got on the road, but only after having paid the five-lev resort fee on our way out of Albena, which reminded me of my beautician’s theory: ‘I paid that fee from my heart; it was for our protection, wasn’t it? It’s an extra precautionary measure against having your car stolen. You can’t drive the car out of the resort unless you show the entry ticket.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit that from Albena onwards I could feel the blood hysterically throbbing through my veins. I hate saying idiotic clichés such as ‘Bulgarians are a nation of...’, ‘Romanian always...’ etc., but, I have to remark that the road infrastructure in Bulgaria, especially at nightfall, is an utter nightmare: full of holes and lacking any sort of signals. I’ve no idea how crossing Varna comes as easy as pie to some, but we ended up driving around through every neighbourhood and slum until we hit upon the exit towards Burgas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one golden rule: never go to the supermarket on an empty stomach; I’d add another one after this Bulgarian experience: never go to the heart of Bulgarian industrial tourism without a previous booking. Approaching Nesebar, the lights in the back keep pressuring you (just like on the Romanian A2 motorway - nicknamed The Sun Motorway - in August), honks will drive you mad, while on your left and right huge colonies of industrial, mammoth-like structures with rooms for tourists rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know that congestion of apartment blocks queerly thrown in the field, huddled into one another as if in front of an execution platoon, a view representative of a transition-driven Eastern Europe? Well, starting with Elenite, Bulgaria does provide a great example regarding the capacity / footprint relation. If such architectural sights are rather scarce in the Romanian industrial area, in Bulgaria, this area itself is full to the brim with tourists. As far as the eye can see, only barren outskirts, looking almost squatted by new gigantic hotels exhibiting ghetto features, with tens of thousands of apartments that are rented as vacation homes, with kitchen and balcony, with a boutique on the ground floor, a washing machine in the bathroom and smells of fried onion in the kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The image of Bulgaria’s savagely exploited tourism is breathtaking not only through its enormous union-like accommodation capacity, but also through its indifference to common spaces, waste grounds between hotels, the chipped asphalt and the residue from the construction materials thrown away into the neighbour’s yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bulgarian seaside stretching from Albena to Primorsko has two facets: one wallowing in dust and weeds, with resorts on the city outskirts where cranes from the days of the building sites can still be seen, and a cardboard one, exhibiting stately hotels with marble columns, inner malls and pools with palm trees, all-inclusive services and waiters in tuxedos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dusty facet presents the same architectural disease of Romanian buildings – incoherent and mismatched buildings (even in terms of bad taste), while the cardboard one is coloured by people with average income, their heads filled with dreams of luxury, who spend a week as if on a film set, miming their celebrity and wealth and virtually never laying eyes on the sea because they spend their vacation at the hotel pool, hide behind ‘Channel’ sunglasses, harbour a seemingly indifferent attitude to the surrounding ‘luxury’ and lie in the shade of plastic palm trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Falling into the first category is Sozopol where one can relive the folksy feeling at a fair by measuring the force in one’s fist when hitting a punching bag and one’s resistance when taking a ride on the dress (with the paint chipped) of a huge ballerina, which can be quite fun if you do it with a sense of humour; next comes Primorsko, offering you great food if you go by the restaurants with wooden tables and smells of fried fish. Falling into the second category is Sunny Beach where we put up at a hotel on Sunny   Beach Mall Street, right opposite a… mall that blocked the view of the seaside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Sozopol onwards, the Bulgarian seaside can breathe in relief. Unfortunately, the road isn’t close to the coast, so until one reaches the Turkish border, the entire drive feels like a long sleep with spots of light on the asphalt. In Sinemorets, one starts to fall in love with Bulgaria; pity this is the end. The landscape is marked by high cliffs whose base hides secluded beaches with fine sand and salty waves. On the left of the village, a spit of beach (separating a lake from the sea) stretches; there, hidden under a cliff, is a small garden with an improvised roof of advertising banners, serving fried anchovies at a price as cheap as chips, cold beer and great music. The village roads lead one into shaded gardens, accommodation is easy to find (either with the villagers or in dainty boarding houses), the main street is enveloped in fruits and the supermarkets in ayran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A piece of advice for future trips: if you reach Sinemorets, make sure you have leva on you. There are <em>no bureaux de change</em> whatsoever and the locals are positive you’re trying to rip them off with fake dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And because, before leaving Sinemorets to go to Turkey, we decided to have a bite, Bulgaria left me with a taste of fresh cucumbers, buried under a layer of salad leaves.  This is what Bulgarian salads were made of everywhere we went: 75% cucumbers stifled by a bunch of salad leaves, a boiled egg and three tomato slices. I may not be a fan of cucumbers, but, even if I were, I’d still feel a bit screwed over. However, every Bulgarian salad I had put a smile on my face as it reminded me of a friend who was in the West on a scholarship and was virtually going hungry. He’d eat at the students’ canteen and, in order to save whatever money he could, he’d hide a hunk of roast under the salad leaves...</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(910,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-09-27',NULL,NULL,'K?y?köy, Turkey','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/51.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/61.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Sinemorets on we longed for the ten-kilometre coast road separating us from Turkey. Unfortunately, there’s no other customs office such as the one in Vama Veche, right in the lip of the sea, so we had to take the winding road through the mountains and, thus, drive away from the sea, along the border, until we reached the first customs office: Malko Tarnovo. And afterwards go back to the Black Sea, but this time, on Turkish territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry into Turkey surprised us with tricksy customs officers, friendly smiles and impeccable road infrastructure. In short: a delight. Suddenly, the radio station turned from international hit songs to ethnic musical pieces, the landscape was green and mild, the sun warmed the asphalt, the air was clear and, gradually, a craving for figs and ?skender kebap seized us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First stop: K?rklareli; stone walls and women with headscarves, white minarets and blue turrets, jewellers and cloth merchants. The small bazaar downtown gave off touching smells of moth flakes and Chinese products. We parked in the great square of that little town and Petru? nipped to exchange some money. He returned within an hour, mumbling incoherently, his money intact, hurling curse words at the asphalt: he entered the bank, he was given an order number and he had to helplessly wait and watch as people who came in after him got smaller order numbers and, therefore, got in front of him, etc. While he was giving vent to his anger, the peacefulness of this little country town and the call of the muezzin had enveloped me, which infuriated him even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We exchanged the money at a very good rate at the first jeweller we came across (a piece of advice: if you can’t find foreign exchange offices, just go to tradesmen who might provide a better rate). Unlike Bulgaria, where nobody wants to exchange your money, here everybody’s willing to do it without the slightest sign of mistrust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in their first spring trip, Petru? and ?tefan passed up some recommendations to visit fishermen’s villages, we decided to take the advice of a friend who, in a few words, simply said: ‘don’t miss K?y?köy’. We reached K?y?köy at nightfall. From high up, on the hill, we could feel the sea breeze; the road was blocked by herds of cows returning home, in the distance we got a glimpse of several modern, unfinished, wishy-washy and alarmingly unaccommodating constructions. We entered the new and relatively deserted village, and, amidst our general mental whirl, ended up in front of a Byzantine stone arcade, carved into the wall of a former fortress. On the other side was the world of a genuinely picturesque (and very contemporary at the same time) little fishermen’s village, with workshops of fishing nets and tea houses with wooden chairs outside, but also with a heavily (neon) lit supermarket and a few empty tourist buses which were leaving for Istanbul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instant we started to get the scent of K?y?köy village, we felt that pure emotion that seizes and thrills you when discovering an extraordinary place out of the blue. We walked on the main street paved in stone, our nostrils were delighted by the pottage and köfte smells, we accepted an invitation to a lentil soup (mercimek), but, later on, we took a squint at the moustachioed men aligned on the side of the street, on small chairs, a cigarette between their lips and a row of beads in their hand. We listened again to the call of the muezzin and watched the fishermen lay down their fishing nets which they had pieced and straighten themselves up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finding accommodation was a piece of cake. At the end of the village, the sea breeze was blowing strongly and the wind was lashing against the rocks on which the village was built. Downwards, a small fish harbour of an olden, but tidy, air, a row of barracks with the blinds drawn and, in the background, a wonderful beach on which a flock of goats were bouncing towards the sea. We were looking at the fishing vessels, swaying to the movement of the waves, fascinated by their beautiful paintwork, when an old man asked us: ‘Pansyion?’ And how! So we followed him along the narrow streets, with red peppers planted in wooden boxes (usually used for olive oil), until we reached a house with a yard full of flowers and a little wooden bench from which, as far as the eye could see, the sea in all its splendour revealed itself. In the meantime, the old man’s wife appeared; while her husband showed us the room, she kept smiling and holding my hand and miming the sea breeze blowing in through the window. ‘Pansyion’ was the only word we had in common. From there on, they spoke in Turkish and we in Romanian, in the hope that our languages would reach a common ground at one point. However, that didn’t happen. But it wasn’t an obstacle at all; their house felt like that of a couple of imaginary grandparents speaking a foreign tongue, but in warm and comforting tones.  This was our home for four entire days. A house with a living-room, three bedrooms, wall carpets with <em>The Abduction from the Seraglio</em>, carpets, knick-knacks and plastic roses, a white-lime kitchen equipped with everything a summer kitchen is supposed to have (from gas cylinders to tea cups). Although the general aspect was that of poverty, everything was as neat as a pin and the house harboured a salty air coming from the sea. And no, the grandparents didn’t stay with us; they stayed in their old parents’ house in the yard. At one point, two Dutchmen showed up and they were promptly settled in one of the other two bedrooms with girls driven from Istanbul, who’d startle at the slightest gesture of amiability. They told us that Istanbul (in the heat of the season) was an utter nightmare, that any wide smile would cost you your pockets, that they would have preferred the Turks to have been less friendly, rather than cheat them of their money (and that with a big grin on their faces). K?y?köy was chosen completely at random and they ended up here tense and almost broke. They slept non-stop for two days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A little cardboard plate with a handwritten ‘Pansyion Bulunur’ was hanging on the gate of the house. We wrote it down and, from then on, to whoever asked about our accommodation, we’d answer as locals: we’re staying with the Bulunurs. The funny thing was during our entire stay in Turkey, another ‘Bulunur’ would spring up here and there – a ‘Bulunur’ restaurant, a ‘Bulunur’ mercimek and, again, ‘Bulunur’ pansyion… Apparently, we didn’t stay at the Bulunur family, ‘bulunur’ meaning something like ‘we are’ or – a more appropriate translation – ‘boarding house accommodation’, ‘we’ve got food’, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(914,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-09-28',NULL,NULL,'Fishermen in Turkey, poachers in Romania','<div><p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve always wondered what the poachers on the Turkish fishing vessels displaying random flags and being summoned with hundreds of gunshots by the Romanian border police look like. Judging by the news in Romania, the scenario is always the same. The Turkish poachers swaggeringly wave the Ukrainian or Romanian flag hoping to pass unnoticed, the Romanian frontier policemen ‘pick up their scent’ and summon them by machine guns until they surrender themselves, but not before throwing overboard most of the game. In the end, everybody goes home, except for the captains who get to be investigated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I had the chance to meet them in the little harbour  of K?y?köy where several fishing vessels (exceeding the entire Romanian fleet) kept rocking and I couldn’t help thinking of our fishermen who seem to have descended from the Prehistoric Era with their warped boats as if made from one single tree trunk. The fishing nets lay nicely piled up in the sun, the barracks, where the fish was unloaded, looked spick and span and the fishermen were sipping tea after tea gazing into the distance. There was a sea storm and the weather didn’t seem to improve sooner than three, four days. Cheerful and eager to chat, they pulled their chairs around us and started to ask us about our life, clinging on to their boss, the only speaker of English in the entire harbour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we mentioned Romania, I was positive their faces would light up and they’d nod their heads in delight: ‘Hagi, Hagi. Lucescu.’ Well, I was about to have the biggest surprise of my life. They started to grin to one another and exchange cheerful glances. Some of them got to their feet and held out their wrists joined together. ‘Virtually everybody here has spent a few days in the Romanian prisons for poaching’, their boss translates and adds that his own brother got some time in the Romanian nick last spring. The time spent there doesn’t seem to have had any traumatizing effect on any of them; actually, judging by their grinning faces and the warm, puckish looks thrown our way (as if to their younger, dumb friends who got screwed over), they see it as a very successful prank. And they did get screwed over, because, while their Bulgarian and Romanian neighbours are fighting at the European Commission for dividing the brill fishing quotas, they poach it like crazy and sell it on the black market in Istanbul for 30-40 Euros/kg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst that morning’s peacefulness and the general giggle, a firm and vigorous ‘cock-a-doodle-doo’ rose above it all, triggering an explosion of exhilaration among the fishermen. Their boss plucked our sleeves and invited us into his floor-tiled office (with a heap of registers on his desk) where an old man was knotting some fishing nets and on a cupboard a white, red-combed rooster reigned. ‘That’s our clock’ he says, at which the fishermen burst out laughing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We passed by there the following day. The rooster was gone. Apparently, it had been only a day’s joke induced by the fishermen’s boredom on a day with a stormy sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(924,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-09-30',NULL,NULL,'The people we met','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/24.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/34.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/09/43.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We went on every little street in K?y?köy and looked into the people’s yards where we saw the women stripping the corn cobs of their kernels, hanging the laundry in the sun and working with the pots in the kitchen, the children playing with hand-carved wooden fishing vessels, the men sipping tea after tea while sitting at tea tables or preparing their fishing nets by lantern light…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The huge sea waves were lashing out, the little magnetic fishing harbour and the beach stretching behind it had us all spellbound. And, apparently, we weren’t the only ones fascinated by it. The road to the beach crosses an old and rather ramshackle culvert, daily trodden upon by flocks of goats and herds of cows driven to the seashore to cool off. There was only one man on the beach. Armed with a shovel, as soon as the waves receded, he would dart to the ground grubbing for angleworms which he used when fishing on the harbour dam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From afar, it looked like a workers’ barracks, from up close, a little fishermen’s restaurant (made of plate), with an earthen floor and copper stove in the middle, with clean vinyl tablecloths and family pictures on the walls and, to top it all, Atatürk’s framed picture in a place of honour. Outside the dusty heat was winnowed from time to time by blasts of wind, inside it was chilly, the place smelled of cleanliness and boredom and the owner of the restaurant was happily running to and fro, ecstatic to finally have clients. After having served us tea and got to arranging various objects (which appeared to be in the right places), he sat down at the table next to us and, a wide smile on his face, started to talk. He seemed glad and not at all embarrassed by the fact that his jabbering was all Greek to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At one point he rose to his feet and beckoned Petru? to follow him. He led him to the kitchen in the back where the fish were ready, all cleaned up, their bellies cut up and arranged like soldiers waiting for their clients; he showed Petru? the kettle of hot tea and all the drawers and shelves arranged in an obsessive order. We promised him we’d return in the evening to have dinner and he thanked us by touching his heart with his hand. When we left, we paid for the tea and the guy took the money, placed it on his forehead and then flung it to the ground. And thus came to be our first word in common: ‘handsel’. Afterwards, he discreetly followed us to the first place in the harbour where we stopped for another cup of tea and popped up out of the blue, offered to pay for our drinks and bragged to the fishermen that we were his friends. This time, however, we had an interpreter (the harbour administrator), the only speaker of English in that little bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We returned to the restaurant in the evening, but our friend wasn’t by himself this time. A young family with a five-year-old little boy was sitting at one of the tables. The place was so small and the walls were keeping us so close to one another that the conversation developed naturally in English, as if in the living-room of a common friend, a man of the world. The father was Turkish, the mother Bulgarian and the child spoke to the mom in Bulgarian and to the dad in Turkish. They were currently living in Bulgaria, though the dad had previously lived in Romania. The talk revolved around the Black Sea. In brief, the Bulgarian would vilify Bulgaria’s seaside, we’d do the same with the Romanian one, while the Turk would speak proudly of the Turkish seaside, but would also manage to find a few nice words to say about the Romanian and Bulgarian ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this subtle lesson of elegant and moderate patriotism, the conversation turned to a subject that had us all worked up: arugula. How come the arugula of Turkey looks like a huge radish and is available everywhere, while in Bulgaria and Romania you can find it only in certain supermarkets, in small quantities and overcharged? We racked our brains trying to find an explanation, then we advised one another to grow our own arugula, some on the balcony, others in the garden, according to everyone’s country and financial possibilities…which turned out we had already done and had developed beautifully. In the end, we all warmly shook hands and let our new Turkish friend negotiate our bill with our old Turkish friend. The result: our bill was considerably smaller than theirs, although we had had pretty much the same things…which stirred a little heated discussion between the two Turks, something like Turks will be Turks and, if possible, they will swindle you of your money, a big smile on their face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From afar, she appeared to be a tiny woman dressed in a burqa, a shadow walking parallel to the walls. When she got in front of us and saw Petru? trying to photograph her, she coquettishly arranged her headdress and smiled into the camera. Actually, it wasn’t a burqa she was wearing, but rather a black, not very strict, cloth which, during our time together, she took off and put back on several times (depending on the wind force), revealing a bold fuchsia headgear. She laughed a lot and sat facing the sea, her gaze piercing the horizon, showing us something in the distance and telling stories we couldn’t understand anyway. She beckoned me to sit next to her and she started to ask me questions (I became aware of that by the interrogative tone used at the end and the eagerness in her eyes). At first, her gestures and signs led me to understand she was waiting for her son to return from the sea, then I realized the son was supposed to leave for the sea, but was prevented by the sea storm, and, finally, I understood that she was actually waiting for the sun to set which I think is the right version because the second we heard the call of the muezzin, she suddenly got up and said ‘haydi!’. And this was our word: ‘haydi!’ (<em>‘come on!’ </em>in English and <em>‘haide!’ </em>in Romanian). She gestured she was going to eat for the first time that day. The sunset marked the end of the day’s fasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We met Rose in a traditional Turkish camping in ??neada, a small village-resort on the Black  Sea coast, very close to the Bulgarian border. Because we couldn’t understand her name, she told us it meant ‘rose’ in Turkish. So we should call her Rose. She is a math teacher in Istanbul and in the summertime she makes earrings and bracelets which she sells at the resort fair. She sleeps in her car during the entire summer and, because she doesn’t put up her tent, she is exempt from paying the daily three-lev fee. Traditional Turkish camps look like happy refugees’ camps. The camping places are enclosed by various signs and entire families put up three or four high used tents made of military canvas, thus recomposing a real household, with a place to wash she dishes and a mirror in front of which the men can shave, a little stove working on wood where they make the tea, with a little table and carpet (set on the grass) where they eat and welcome their neighbours (who come to visit), with kettles hanging on trees and cooking cauldrons lain in the sun to dry. Rose is the only speaker of English and she invites us to sit on the little carpet with other five people of different ages. We quickly learn that she’s just visiting, but the others are part of a three-generation family and have come to spend their summer at the seaside. The grandmother’s rocking her grandchild in an improvised hammock, while the others are waiting for their sons who have gone fishing on the lake behind the camp. We stayed there for an hour, during which time they made tea twice, smoked and made fun of the boys who’d most likely return empty-handed. They described their life to us, how many surgeries and children they had, how they all met and how much they loved one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(931,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-10-01',NULL,NULL,'Turkey during Ramadan','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our first days in Turkey were marked by a strange sensation of tense expectancy. The beaches were deserted, the streets were enveloped in slumber and the breeze was blowing beautifully, filling the empty spaces around us with salty air. It seemed we had miraculously discovered the last secluded spots with a sea view and full services. A wide choice of select accommodations, small family restaurants with great food and view to the sea, that pleasant feeling that no matter where you went and on which chair you sat on, you’d feel at people’s home. And all that just for us. Wherever we entered, wherever we walked, we were virtually the only tourists there. And yet, those empty spaces, the tens of vacant tables and chairs around us, the unoccupied chaises longues on the beach, it all induced a state of permanent tension, awaiting the hordes of tourists that’d never come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without even planning it, we happened to land in Turkey during Ramadan. And that’s how we discovered the sacred month of the Muslims is the best period to visit Turkey. This year, Ramazan (the Turkish name of this feast) coincided with the peak of the tourist season: August 11<sup>th</sup> – September 8<sup>th</sup>, which turned every resort on the shore of the Black Sea into quiet and calm establishments. But that’s also because the Black Sea coast, much wilder and more rural than that of the Aegean Sea or the Sea of Marmara, comes last on the list of foreign tourists’ preferences. However, that doesn’t hold true for the Turkish tourists who dedicated the month of Ramadan to prayer, fasting and introspection. During this time, the Muslims don’t eat, drink or smoke until sunset. The second the sun sets, the call of the muezzin is heard and the streets become animated with life, smells of hot ‘pide’ (pita) and fresh spices fill everybody’s nostrils. For travellers with an unquenchable curiosity and an open mind to the people and places they see, this time of the year allows them to catch a glimpse of traditional Turkey which outshines the summer season hubbub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first few days, when we still hadn’t perceived the silence around us as the silence of Ramadan, when the small fishermen’s village of K?y?köy still preserved the mystery of a new and fully unexplored place, we came across the second beach of the village, at the other end of the harbour, a beach with fine sand, pedalos, camping for tourists and gardens with soft and puffy chairs. In this part of the village we discovered a few gardens and restaurants offering fresh fish and delicious dishes of eggplants, fat yoghurt and garlic, baked peppers and squashes, well-ground and well-cooked mutton, served by smiling, friendly faces willing to communicate with you in the shred of international language they spoke. That’s the first time, I think, that we sensed the tense expectancy in the air. The place obviously lacked its tourists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We felt the same in ??neada, a small resort on the Bulgarian border, with a huge beach, a row of empty gardens and little deserted hotels, silent discos, a flea market of coloured balloons and second-hand clothes filled only with tradesmen, a small inflatable amusement park (which was deflated when we arrived) and tens of tables with hookahs and not a soul to smoke them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took in ??neada as a quiet little village, with much bigger and more stunning houses than those of K?y?köy, a wonderful holiday atmosphere with beach, sea and many places to visit. ??neada showed us that a resort stripped of tourists does, by no means, look indecent, but rather like a film set in those moment of apparent quietness between shots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(943,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-10-10',NULL,NULL,'The agony of the Romanian seaside *','<p>\r\n<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/21.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p>As the project <strong>Around the Black Sea</strong> began in Romania, it will also end in Romania, but not before passing through a poverty-ridden Dobruja (though dominated by windmills), more precisely, through several Lipovan villages with flowers on the streets, confirming the saying: ‘a good farmer makes a good farm’.

And because we decided to save our opinions and impressions about the Romanian seaside for a compact series of posts dedicated exclusively to Romania, here we are, talking about the sun and the beach ‘under the auspices of the first snowflakes’. A wacky and inappropriate moment, just like the Romanian seaside.</p>\r\n<p>‘Snakes, tigers…footballer German boxers!’, ‘Don’t waste money on crap, buy your children a snap!’, ‘A photo a day keeps the doctor away!’, ‘Pumpkin seeds will make you say <em>cheeeese</em>!’, ‘Salt sticks and beer will make you cheer!’, ‘Come get your corn, get your fried corn!’</p>\r\n<p>The Romanian seaside isn’t what it used to be…No more rhymes, the Swedish ladies have switched to the Bulgarian seaside, Vier Pfoten freed the monkeys, corn is genetically modified, the sea advances in menacing crawls and will soon swallow the Obelisk and the Gypsies are roasting seeds on Platze in Paris. One would say the Romanian seaside is ready to breathe its last after the ruffian abuses of the past twenty years, after the disgrace constantly brought upon it in the press and on every media channel where people appalled by the state of the Romanian seaside could voice themselves.</p>\r\n<p>Well, things aren’t exactly like this. I passed by the seaside this summer and it’s doing great. Although the years have left some marks… Its hair is starting to really thin on top and it’s grown quite a big beer belly, but, otherwise, it’s got the same liveliness (as ever) pouring out of the speakers and still spends the summers with the same rude waiters and the same roughnecks with the beer pack attached to them. I hadn’t seen it in a while and I became nostalgic for the old swim ring and Radio Vacan?a tunes. However, I got over it quickly. The second we entered Costine?ti, I felt a clawing pain gnawing at my stomach and a harrowing headache on my temples that just wouldn’t go away, not even when we glided through the myriad of sheets spread on the beach so Petru? could take pictures.</p>\r\n<p>The beach of Costine?ti highly resembles an overcrowded arena of bloodthirsty animals, stimulated by a reverberating music bordering on frenzy. The music is booming from every possible direction and wherever you turn, all you see are rows of grinning mugs, showing their fangs in an eternal grimace of happiness due to their presence at the seaside and to the general fun they’re having. A forced duty to have fun, a race against the clock is hovering in the air: who can pull the most pranks, who can laugh the loudest, who can show the people on the sheet next to them (in the most original and persuasive manner) and the folks back home and they should envy them as they’re having way more fun than them.</p>\r\n<p>No. There’s nothing natural in the explosion of youthfulness in Costine?ti. It’s something rather tired, dirty and ridiculous, just like the Romanian seaside where cigarette stubs thrown on the beach rival the sand grains, where seawater smells of sunscreen and also has a limy layer of SPF sun lotion, where a bath into the sea resembles a bath in an oversized tub between apartments blocks where you bathe at a fixed time with all your neighbours, where the evening sets in on a sea of garbage left on the beach and where medical care points are decreasing while the number of food poisoning cases are on the rise.</p>\r\n<p>Watching the abundance of sheets and chaises longues, leaving virtually no room to pass, Petru? noticed an interesting thing. Russian or Ukrainian anti-consumerism is a scathing reply to the hysterical Romanian consumerism. On no other beach around the Black Sea do people spend as much as on Romanian beaches. The other beaches, as popular and crowded as ours, remain as clean as a whistle at the end of the day because those people do limit their spending to much more moderate sums. Seldom will one see someone with a beer or peanut bag in their hands. Romanian consumerism comes obsessively, furiously and in huge quantities: seeds, warm beer, baked corn, inflatable animals…and so on till the day ends.</p>\r\n<p>The headache finally went away when we reached the range of resorts bearing the names of the planets in our solar system. The atmosphere was indeed much more peaceful, there were beaches of fine sand and a less eroded seafront, nice-looking canteens of accessible prices, smells of doughnuts and noisy kids. In a way, I believe Saturn and Venus have best preserved the atmosphere of ‘80s holidays; those yearning for Romanian summer holidays of the past will surely find them there. As a bonus, here’s an image that’s been haunting me since my childhood, an image I had come to believe I myself had invented: people walking on water, just like Jesus. Well, that’s how the entry into the sea looks like in Saturn and Venus. Tens of metres of water reach a low level.</p>\r\n<p>To conclude, the Romanian seaside is as swarming with people as it was in the days of ‘Greetings from the sunny Black Sea seaside’ postcards. The only difference is that today it’s really expensive. So expensive you feel like punching the receptionist requesting 200 RON for a damp room with a window giving onto the patio where the ventilation from the canteen is done. Although she isn’t the guilty one. Nobody is. You are the guilty one because, despite every warning, you still gave the Romanian seaside another shot.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>*This post wasn’t sponsored by the political detractors of Elena Udrea, just like the posts about Bulgaria didn’t benefit from a financial reward from the supporters of this distinguished lady, but, if either of the two parties wishes to support the <strong>Around the Black Sea</strong> project, they’re welcome to do so.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(958,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-10-13',NULL,NULL,'E misto la Techirghiol','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/32.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/42.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/61.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/71.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation was rather embarrassing. Petru? in blue Speedos, covered in a heavy, shiny black layer of mud out of his sincere wish to become part of the motley group come for treatment; an old couple, buck naked, in a bizarre composition, as black as coal, little white summer hats on their heads, their legs sprawled on the sheet, reading the newspaper, their arms away from the body... Though reluctant at first, Petru? approached them and popped the question: ‘May I take your picture?’ The couple stared at him for...one, two, three, four, five seconds, then one of them said grinning: ‘Given the situation...yes.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What did I know about Techirghiol? Ever since my childhood days, I knew it was the place where the train, on its way to the seaside, slowed down and dangerously tilted to one side, that you could spy on naked people through the holes of the concrete fence, that it got some weird smells, that people daubed themselves with pitch-black mud and that there, on shore, right at the entry to the lake, the water was as black as an abysmal hole. I also knew it was good for rheumatism, that you could swim in Lake Techirghiol, that, even if you didn’t know how to swim, it was also a spot preferred by nudists and old people. And, last, but not least, I knew that under no circumstances was I to let myself get roped into going there as consequence of one of the most ridiculous and unpleasant experiences of my childhood. Indeed, although it might seem a fun activity, a child forced to smear mud all over her body and afterwards wash it off in salty, foul water (which also got into her eyes), might perceive this experience as something extremely displeasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the most part, these are some of my childhood memories/impressions of Techirghiol, impressions which haven’t changed in the last twenty years. The decision to include Techirghiol in this project meant I was dead set against dipping one single finger in that healing mud. However, the situation quickly turned around, not in my favour. I would sabotage the project. One simply cannot walk, camera in hand, among mud-smeared people, as if one were in a zoo. It’s offensive and completely... unprofessional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this summer I decided to cover myself in mud in the ‘Mother and child’ quarter on the Techirghiol beach and I bloody loved it. I’ve no idea why it’s called that, but ‘Mother and child’ is the code name for that part of the beach open to both men and women, where people in bathing suits come together with their friends to fix their bones and hangover, where retired people are relaxed and funny, where youngsters, children and old people, drenched in the silky black mud, become new chess pieces and walk back and forth on the path separating the sand in two, in what is an amusing choreography of straw hats, sunglasses and crosswords puzzles. It’s obvious many of those meeting here have been coming for years; they know one another and that makes the general atmosphere on the beach very relaxed and intimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there was something else that made me come back. Besides the buttery mud (which I don’t know if it’s actually effective, but it sure does leave your skin much softer), besides that salty lake (which makes you think you’re a great swimmer who could easily cross it, even if the truth of it is that you can’t cross a channel), it’s that peacefulness and old-fashioned look to it that lured me back. I like exactly what other people reproach Techirghiol: that, although it’s got a huge potential and it could be a very popular treatment spa, it’s the same as it was fifty years ago. The beach of Techirghiol might not be modern, but it sure as hell doesn’t look shabby. It’s an old-fashioned, but clean spot, just like a modest, but tidy household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it’s not like I didn’t see the run-down aspect of the stone passageway under the main road, leading to the entry to the beach, or the headless showers and the chipped slabs. It’s just that it simply didn’t bother me. I love the fact that, after this experience, I cannot imagine a more awesome idea for me and my friends than a summer morning on the Techirghiol beach, our eyes half-shuttered with sleep, a light hangover, our whole bodies covered in mud and our legs soaking in such a salty water it reminds me of the lump of salt my grandpa used when his hand shook while shaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(960,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-10-15',NULL,NULL,'Dobruja is on its uppers','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/33.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/43.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/51.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/62.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being as poor as a church mouse, Dobruja seems to be the most dignified region of Romania. Poor, rough, remote, its ground full of deep ridges caused by drought, breathtakingly beautiful wilderness where pheasants, rabbits, Romanians,  Bulgarians, hedgehogs, Lipovans, Italians, Greeks, does, Ruthenians, boars, Aromanians, Turks, Tatars live together in harmony, without any prejudices or conflicts whatsoever. Dobruja is an interethnic kneader of an overwhelming tolerance force.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s an exotic tinge to the names of the villages of Dobruja which sound like blank verse-poetry in an unknown tongue Turcoaia, Peceneaga, Hamcearca, Cogealac, Cerna, Atmagea, Ciucurova.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aromanians live in Ceamurlia. In Greci live Italians, in Izvoarele greci, in Slava Cercheza there are Lipovans and in Cerchez<sup>1</sup> you’ll find anyone, but Circassians as they left Dobruja at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, in Babadag live the Tatars, in Medgidia Turks and Bulgarians everywhere, though their numbers were much higher before the 1940 population exchange. Actually, the more I try to put the nations of Dobruja in order, the unfairer I am. The cultural mix of Dobruja goes so deep that you cannot find a village with just one ethnic community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aromanians have sheep and stone houses and some of them young wives married off by their parents according to the old customs. The Tatars stormed in, but nowadays they’re becoming fewer and fewer. They built blue, sharp-topped mosques and gradually took to speaking the Osman language, a Western version of Turkish. They became allies with their brothers, the Turks, both on a political and culinary level as each party has a representative in the Romanian parliament and their contribution to the cuisine of Dobruja has been phenomenal. The Italians from Greci imposed themselves as <a href=\"http://www.divers.ro/italieni_o_localitate_unica_ro\">stonemasons</a>. To cure themselves from diseases they use sage and castor oil extensively. The pork dishes are made exactly like those of Rovigo, Italy: dry salami and prosciutto – the back of the pork is dried up in the attic by means of a special technique. Concerning the Greeks from Izvoarele, the only compact, rural community of Greeks in Romania, you’ve got a different <a href=\"http://revistacultura.ro/nou/2010/01/un-model-al-supravietuirii-grecii-din-izvoarele/\">story</a>. And it goes something like this: around 1828 the refugees from Thessaloniki who had reached Bessarabia following the Russian-Turkish war of 1820-1821 stopped in Dobruja to catch their breath. Meanwhile, a baby was born in their camp and, as tradition says neither child, nor mother are allowed to leave that place, they remained there temporarily until they settled for good, especially after having seen how well the wood trade (most of all in Tulcea, where wooden boats were made) was going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old histories of Dobruja’s people are deeply moving and full of unfinished stories.  Maia<sup>2</sup>’s (the Aromanian) story still haunts me. She was born in Balchik and left it at seventeen. The evacuation order took them all by surprise, turning their lives upside down: they had to get everything they had (pillows, dishes, animals, wardrobes, old people, children) in their carts and, overnight, they were filed in a convoy and sent to Romania. The Bulgarians and Aromanians helplessly looked into their eyes as they passed one another. Seventy years have passed since Romanian-Bulgarian population exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, Dobruja constitutes one huge paradox from one end to the other: it can boast of a rich history, but it is on its uppers, it has the highest density of ethnic communities, but it’s close to becoming a ghost town since it has tens of abandoned villages, left prey to creepers, it has the oldest mountains in Europe and the newest sources of energy; as far as the eye can see, Dobruja’s mountain tops, more and more ground, resembling prehistoric animals with each passing day, are dominated by a myriad of windmills, as if they were part of a futuristic movie; Dobruja has probably the most valuable fauna and flora of Romania and yet, the number of tourists is alarmingly low; while the sails of the windmills are spinning deals of thousands of Euros, in the yards of adobe houses one can see clay ovens where pita is baked, not for the sake of <em>green living</em>, but because many people here cannot afford to buy bread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To me, Dobruja is braga<sup>3</sup> and mutton pie, it’s got a special light and its window sills are painted in the most wonderful blue, its people (or, at least, those who still live there) are simply awesome and its atmosphere is unique. And it’s got something more: bad luck. Or maybe a penchant for depression inherited by the many wretched histories that have converged here. Anyway, today’s Dobruja looks like a ‘no man’s land’ with nobody on its side, a land I’d like to make right again.

Romanian villages in Dobruja look like sick animals awaiting their death. On the same motorway, under the same ‘curse’, Lipovan villages mock poverty with their freshly whitewashed houses, whose window sills are painted in a breathtaking blue and their streets filled with flowers.</p>\r\n<p>The atmosphere of Lipovan villages is best defined by order and cleanliness. Not that big of a deal. It’s something natural; however, when your eyes are used to fences with missing planks, yards decorated with broken tyres, broken refrigerators, sofas with busted springs, seeing tidy yards, laundry laid out on ropes to dry and piles of wood neatly stacked feels like waking up from one heavy, depressing slumber.</p>\r\n<p>The second we entered Jurilovca, an infusion of colours invigorated us. From one end to the other, the village is replete with small, delicate, mild, neat and wonderfully preserved flowers. A good farmer <em>does</em> make a good farm, we thought. And went on thinking it for the few days spent there, as the people of Jurilovca opened up to us, opened their yards, proof that everybody got up early in the morning... Jurilovca came as a surprise to us. Located at the edge of the sea, towards, Gura Porti?ei, we had expected to find a village under the rule of real estate developers, smothered by pensions with stainless steel balcony railing and pontoons for speedboats. We were deeply wrong. Jurilovca proved to be a traditional, honest village with the type of community that go about their business even when tourists come by.</p>\r\n<p>We met C?t?lin at the fishery. We were walking among the boats lifted on stilts waiting to get either painted or welded here and there where the joints had cracked and we could smell the tar used to oil the fishermen’s wooden boats. The little harbor was humming with life, the atmosphere was great; it almost looked like a place frozen in time, a place where engineers wore caps and blue overalls, where they smoked at the lathe and the workday ended at four. Did Jurilovca experience the revolution or not? It did as the channel hasn’t been cleared since then, so navigation has been restricted to small fishermen’s boats. It did experience the revolution because poaching and abusive leasing has halved the number of the village fishermen. Otherwise, in the background, a radio was playing Romanian music, though the signal got weaker and weaker at times, and the people working at the shops had that relaxed mien of the ‘80s. Somehow they had nothing to lose and nothing to gain.</p>\r\n<p>C?t?lin Balaban was our ticket into the community of Lipovan fishermen, the vote of confidence that we were alright and had come in peace. C?t?lin is the head of one of the fishermen’s associations in Jurilovca and we were guided towards him as he was the authority to whom we had to request permission to take pictures. We went to him terror-stricken. In 90 % of the scenarios imagined we would be asked to leave the private property. The opposite happened. Not only did we receive permission to do whatever we wanted, but he took it as a personal challenge: opening the door to the most authentic scrap of the daily life of Lipovans.</p>\r\n<p>So, at six a.m. the next day we were in Victor’s boat advancing quietly on Lake Razelm as if through a photo wallpaper of fishermen’s figures hidden in the reed and a sky of such intense pink hues as only Photoshop could achieve (or so I thought). I will tell you more about Victor in the next post dedicated exclusively to the fishermen on Lake Razelm. However, this image is burnt into my brain: tens of fishermen screaming and hysterically spinning around our boat while Victor was striving to pull the wire nets where the fish had been caught. Victor would remove the dead ones and throw them to the sea gulls: ‘These are my hens. I feed them every morning’, he said laughing.</p>\r\n<p>Around 12 p.m. we had reached the shore, feeling the ground floating under our feet and a net (we couldn’t refuse) in our hands. The net contained the following: zander, carp, catfish, pickerel and bream. We hardly snapped out of it that C?t?lin took charge of us and said: ‘Now you are gonna see what fish borsch really tastes like’. And so we did. A delicious borsch prepared by Hari and his wife on a warm autumn afternoon under their vine arbour. After having removed the scales in a couple of minutes, Hari told us that: ‘The secret is to let the water cover the fish completely. Listen to me. Fish borsch is one of the few things that really matter in life. It was what brought me back home.’</p>\r\n<p>And that is because, disappointed by the evolution of his country, humiliated by the lease of waters, disgusted by poachers and the lack of perspective, Hari has spent the last ten years working abroad. He worked mainly in constructions, but didn’t refuse any other type of work. He ended up carrying volcanic rocks in Tenerife or working as a day labourer in Italy, although he loves fishing. He bore everything, got used to the hard work and the loneliness, homesickness, but one thing left him defenceless: the fish borsch back home. So, when he couldn’t take it anymore, he left everything and returned home.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(1028,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-10-21',NULL,NULL,'Fishing on Lake Razelm','<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/17.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1025\" title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/27.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1026\" title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/38.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1027\" title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/47.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1029\" title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/55.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1030\" title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/66.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1031\" title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/75.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1032\" title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/84.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1033\" title=\"9\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/94.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1034\" title=\"10\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/103.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1035\" title=\"11\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/114.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1036\" title=\"12\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/124.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1037\" title=\"13\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/131.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1038\" title=\"14\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/10/141.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the old days, things went something like this: dawn hadn’t broken yet when the boats would quietly glide down the channel, in groups of eight, connected to one another by bowlines and pulled by a sailboat. Only the sharp cries of birds and the regular rustle of the sea would be heard. And, perhaps, now and then, a fisherman’s yawn. Jokes and banters would begin only after sunrise. Now that’s a real show; as ataman (the leader of an orderly, but motley, group of fishermen), imposing oneself and standing against scathing Lipovan sarcasm is not easy at all. Especially since choosing the spot where the nets are to be thrown in is no child’s play…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was the custom a hundred years ago. Nowadays, in the communities of Lipovan fishermen from Jurilovca and Sarichioi, the custom has remained the same, though with a slight difference: the sailboat pulling the eight-boat convoy has got an engine. Otherwise, while industrial European fishing benefits from sophisticated equipment (with a multitude of little bulbs and electronically controlled devices), seining on Lake Razelm, in October, is done with solemn pomp, as if in a performance at a village museum. Lipovan fishermen disdainfully refuse the use of glass fibre boats and anything modern in the art of fishing. They simply go on drowning the worms drilling through the wood of their old fishing tools by sinking them for days in the lake water and they also go on scarfing their nets as their parents had taught them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the shore, Lake Razelm looks like a sea, and, when the wind blows, huge waves rise up. The seining season has begun in good weather. At six a.m. one could hear only the rubbery squeak of the sixteen pairs of wellingtons getting into the boats. It took us two hours to reach the spot where the first fishing net was thrown. Seining is done with a fascinating choreography:  the eight boats get into a circle, and the fishermen infix the quants in the slimy bottom of the lake whose depth seldom exceeds two metres. Once the boats are steady, the nets are thrown in, forming an underwater circle which begins to close in on its own centre. Throwing in the nets and gathering them lasts at least two hours. At the end you can find yourself empty-handed or with tons of fish. Some of the fishermen say it’s a matter of luck, others say it’s pure science. Whatever it is, it means that luck and science can pass you by. Or strike you just a bit, enough to make you bitter, that is, land only a few hundred kilos of bream, crucian or rudd in your net...as it happened on the first day of seining of this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before, when there was fish in the lake, seining would take even several days and the fishermen would eat and sleep in the boats where they would also make fish borsch. Hari, our Lipovan friend, made us the borsch on a device, that is, a metallic, bottom-sealed cylinder where the fire is made and on which the kettle is placed. It’s been a while since Hari has last made borsch in the boat because the fish in the lake isn’t enough to make them spend entire days on the lake, fishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘They’re after us. The lake has almost no fish anymore, and, on top of everything, they’re hurling taxes at us. They want us mopped up. All the fishermen of Jurilovca will take to their heels. Nobody will be left here; only poachers.’ The first time Hari went abroad to work was when the pond behind his house was leased. One day, he was simply forbidden from going there, the pond where he spent his childhood, the pond on which he’d skate in wintertime and ice fish, the pond which had always given him food, the pond which had always been part of his garden...One day, a fence was raised between him and his pond. ‘I can’t even take a walk there. Apparently, I have to pay a fee...’ Over ten years ago, left home and went to Italy. Then he returned and went to Tenerife. For ten years he hasn’t found peace. And he can neither search, nor find it anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He remembers the fish market in Milan, all the fish lying in a pyramid as if in a picture from National Geographic and himself discreetly checking their gills: ‘I saw people buying them and I felt nothing but pity. Had these people ever tasted fresh fish? I was dying for a bowl of fish borsch. But not made from carrions.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next come to mind the cliffs of Tenerife, luxury cars and people wearing sunglasses as if they were in a mob movies, a boss wallowing in wealth, a boss who had ostentatiously dug a pub in a cliff, such a luxurious life indeed that, looked at from Hari’s yard in Jurilovca (where he doesn’t even have running water), it seems nothing but a joke. So Hari laughs and brings us two black volcanic stones. He shows them to us, smells them, rubs them and says: ‘I carried tones of these stones in Tenerife…’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there’s fisherman Victor with the sea gulls, his ‘hens’ which he feeds in the morning. He agreed to take us along when checking his setlines. He was dripping with sweat while struggling with the quants (gnarled poles rising above water like stakes, with which the wire nets used to catch the fish are fixed), the boat was rocking to and fro while Victor was striving to get the quants out; he told us laughing: ‘to me, this is like a holiday. It’s the easiest job and the most wonderful life. What more could you want? You go out on the lake early in the morning, fresh air, sea gulls all around you...this isn’t work; it’s holiday.’ What Victor wants to point out is that his work here is a piece of cake compared to what he does in Ireland, on the fishing vessels where he has to carry tons of weights, where cold and dampness penetrate his bones, as painfully as a sharp claw, twelve hours a day. ‘Who has the guts to do that type of work? Romanians and Asians. The Irish stay in their cabins. But I can’t complain. It’s hard work, but the pay is good.’ Had he worked only on Razelm, he couldn’t have supported his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the fact that the lake has no more fish, the authorities are simply mocking the last fishermen of Jurilovca. Victor says that, according to the last regulations, he should go fishing with two boats: one for the fish, the other for bookkeeping. He has to have all that paperwork with him in case a surprise control should occur and, therefore, take hold of one of the boats, Victor says half jokingly; he cannot make anything of the changes occurring overnight, of the fact that there’s a difference between a natural person and an authorized person...Isn’t it him in both instances? Although he has tried to be fair, although he has brought everything he was demanded although he has paid all the taxes, everything is enveloped in uncertainty and the thought that a control might pop up and discover he’s missing a paper makes his heart race…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fishing authorization, the Delta tax, the state tax (which you have to pay whether you’ve caught fish or not), city hall taxes, boat taxes, tool taxes, rattle snakes (little plastic fish, with a series on them, which are placed on authorized tools), navigation tax, tax to enter the Delta, ecology tax, other taxes and fees, all of these he has paid; while unfolding his misery, he stops and pricks his ears: ‘Do you hear them?’ He takes his hand to his eyes, scrutinizes the lake, then spitefully spits into the water. ‘See those guys with the motorboat?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘Poachers. They’re here every day. Why aren’t<em> their</em> papers checked? So, you see, am I right not to go into the wide world and do something for myself?’ Really. Are we not right to do it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></p>','','',NULL,NULL),(1058,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-11-03',NULL,NULL,'The last one out did turn off the lights','<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<div><p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"5\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"6\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"7\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img title=\"8\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out of all the places we have visited on this trip which officially ends here, for me the biggest surprise was Dobruja. But the secluded Dobruja, the one avoided today even by the alternative roads advised by the police during peak summer season. What seemed a joke in the ‘90’s, when the first serious wave of emigrants was fleeing the country, shouting behind them ‘the last one out turns off the lights!’ has now become reality. The last one out has already turned off the lights. This region of Romania looks like a deserted land, vandalized and left in the dark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaving Isaccea, Petru?’s disappointment at the sight of the harbour, still hovers over me. He got all worked up, just like when you are overcome with memories of childhood and you realize that you’re elatedly reminiscing in great detail about events that go so far back, you’re surprised you can even recall them. Well, on the way there, Petru? told me about a week he had spent with his uncle on a dredge in a harbour in Isaccea. His uncle, a naval engineer, was doing some work on the boat and had taken him along. It seems that at the time, Isaccea was an important commercial hub that gathered the Danube’s floating iron giants as well as tipsy sailors in the town’s taverns. I can’t tell how much of what he was saying were embellished images viewed through a child’s eyes, but I know for sure that today, there is nothing left of the harbour. Do you know what nothing means? Nothing. It was so deserted and so eerily quiet that you wish you had never laid eyes on the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second thing from Isaccea that stuck in my mind was an amateur fisherman that was launching his fishing line in a dirty, reed-infested pond, out of which he removed, every minute, a feeble and shrivelled fish that resembled a frosted potato. The guy was casting his line in good spirits, without bitterness, simply accepting the way things were, that in the pond he was fishing in, big ships moored once. But who could still dredge here… Just ahead of us was the profile of the former tobacco factory, burnt by fires, with blind windows like a mole, some desolate administration buildings, some horses roaming around and a bunch of children playing among the trash. It seems there once was a hotel here, then a nightclub and then a store. But they all went bankrupt. Before ’89 there was good business here, they were processing entire crops of tobacco, they were farming, there was the harbour... After the revolution, time stood still. And, as a curse, no business came to life again. And, finally, they all left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M?cin, I beheld in awe those mountains that seemed to rise from a completely different script than that of Romania. Massive like the humps of prehistoric animals, with violet rocks coloured by the sunset and with the Old Danube which cut in front of them. We found some fabulous places, with bushy forests like those of fairytales, with trees that bore the traces of summer floods, perfectly resembling swimsuits on sunburned skin and some terrific fishing spots where Petru? caught a young catfish with thick lips and set it free. And so, to give you a complete image, we slept at the only hotel in town - in the area actually - for 150 RON (40E) a night!!! A summer camp room, with three beds and tiny windows, a room that we barely got after the guy from the communal restaurant downstairs, who was also managing the hotel, decided to give us a hard time. We had to hang around for about an hour before he decided to give us the room. Said there was a reservation for it. Right..!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Br?ila was something out of science fiction. It was already dark when we arrived and we walked aimlessly downtown, asking ourselves where the downtown area was. We looked for a hotel, but everything seemed to be going on elsewhere; on the empty pedestrian street nothing was open. We stumbled on a rather fancy hotel, with a beautifully restored interwar style façade; the clerk behaved like we had asked him for drugs, not a room. Like an evasive accomplice. He discretely signalled us to wait, spoke on the phone, told us he’d take us somewhere, we asked him to give us directions to go on our own, he got snagged in his own words and suspiciously mumbled something that it’d be better if he took us himself. He was looking around as if worrying that someone would hear him and then he made a few more calls. We discretely backed away as he was talking on the phone, took a few corners on some dark alleys, at a quick pace, hoping he hadn’t followed us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was funny, but at the same time there was something dark and suspicious in the air in Br?ila that made you laugh half-heartedly. We didn’t really know where we were going, so we were glad to find a police car. We went straight to them and asked where we could find a hotel. They gave us directions grinning...politely. The streets they pointed us to were dark and filled with dogs. Chance had it that the hotel was close by. Although it had a pretentious name, ‘Paris’, the place had a rather obscure entry way. But it was warm inside and when we asked at the reception the price of a room, the answer came in the form of a question: ‘The whole night?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Galati the only businesses that seemed to be flourishing were the haemorrhoid and anal fissure clinics. Banners for special offers to these kinds of services pop up in the most unexpected of corners in Galati. Otherwise, you are followed by the heavy atmosphere of steelwork. Here we had the opportunity to spend a night in the unintentional museum of the Party. The Party’s hotel to be precise, ‘The Sea Cliff’. Although declared completely refurbished, the Party’s hotel continues to live in a time loop. You can teach recent history in the hotel: furniture from the communist ‘Golden Age’, metal ashtrays on a long stem, cleaners in Soviet uniforms that waste time in the hallways drinking coffee, a delicious desk clerk that has been making a hole in her chair for over thirty years, I think, and who gave us the room as one would make a favour to a party colleague. Moreover, we barely extracted some information from her about the internet connection inside the hotel, but, oh boy! did we finally get it… If it didn’t work in the room, we were to go out on the balcony, capture it and take it inside. ‘If it doesn’t work that way either, I don’t know what else to tell you’, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<strong>Translator: Andrei Stoian</strong></div>','','',NULL,NULL),(1067,88,1,'0000-00-00','2010-11-07',NULL,NULL,'Final','<p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p><img title=\"1\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"520\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"2\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"521\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"3\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"519\" /></p>\r\n<p><img title=\"4\" src=\"/RES/uploads/images/wp/2010/11/41.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"518\" /></p>\r\n<p>Two months ago we were concluding the tour of the Black Sea after 80 days, 13.000 kilometres, 11 countries (including the separatist republics) and over 360.000 blog hits at over 80.000 unique visitors. And, to add more flavour to it, we engaged on a trip to Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania, countries we flashed through, looking forward to the great journey ahead of us.</p>\r\n<p>And there was another reason: sometimes it’s better to distance yourself to actually see something too close to you. In order to see Romania with fresh eyes, we preferred to travel through Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova and another group of republics considered to be separatist. So, today, our tour around the Black Sea is coming to an end for the second time. This experience was like a friendly away game. We met, shook hands, but were left flummoxed and pretty wavering as to the conclusions to be drawn. We want this first tour of the Black Sea to be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p>\r\n<p>And, as we didn’t know exactly how to conclude things without actually ending them, we decided each of us was going to say a few words and just leave it trailing...</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ioana Hodoiu: </strong>I think we’ve travelled around the Black Sea tens of times in the last four years. On the map. That’s how long it took. Four years. From the first talk in front of a pint of beer to getting the luggage into the trunk. And not because that’s how long it takes to prepare a journey. The rest is chance. You never know if such a long trip will actually happen. Sometimes, these plans simply do not pan out, they don’t grow; they are like a failed caked.</p>\r\n<p>I clearly remember one morning, three years ago us three travelling on the west coast of Africa, the map on our knees in an abandoned little park in Drumul Taberei. We were in the same formula. I’d say it’s the type of journey that happened only on the map, but now I realize ?tefan is going on the African west coast this winter. These plans have a life of their own and it’s very hard to make a recipe to pass on to others.</p>\r\n<p>For Petru? and ?tefan this trip was a personal project. A happy event made this project get financed at the last moment, only a few days before the departure. They would have gone anyway. For me, the trip itself was not that great, because in spring I had to stay in Romania and become the vital cell of this project, coordinating everything from blog management to finding solutions for the small problems which appeared on the way. Anyway, let’s say the trip turned nice at the end when I joined Petru? and we travelled to Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania, from where we wrote the last twelve posts. On the other hand, my journey on the other side of the earth (over two years ago) proved that things can also be done impetuously, on the run (like: resign, get the visas and plane tickets and take off).</p>\r\n<p><strong>?tefan Cândea:</strong> We managed to travel to every country around the Black Sea without having our car stolen, without falling prey to raket or get swindled out of our money – as we had been warned so many times on the road. The most important thing, however, is that we didn’t pay a dime to the road police, to the customs officers or to the border guards (except in Transdniester where, out of over ten controls in half a day, we gave in to one and paid a twenty-dollar fine for a sham). And that without taking advantage of our status of journalists. As many travel blogs stupidly and repeatedly recommend having a ‘ten-dollar bill ready at hand’, no wonder tourists are seen as a milking cow for any member of the local authorities. Eventually, stupid is he who gives, not he who asks.</p>\r\n<p>When we got back, I was constantly asked about similarities and differences between Romania and the other countries. Regarding major differences, at least on the shore of the Black Sea, nowhere else have I come across the mix of disgust, repugnance, arrogance and trickery present every time I make the mistake of going to the Romanian seaside.</p>\r\n<p>Another major difference would be that every country, except for Romania and Bulgaria, is an open wound bearing deep marks of recent armed conflicts; even Turkey in the issue of the Kurds. Colleagues my age have studied in improvised schools in bunkers, they have lost friends and family in the conflicts. Their parents and grandparents were arrested, deported or executed. The region is similar to the situation in the Balkans in the ‘90s, though at a much larger scale and with conflicts which have spanned over the last century, with abuses and situations of an inconceivable cruelty. The international community, however, had neither a convincing reaction, nor an efficient strategy to mend the situation.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding similarities, an important common point would be the general virulent tone against primitive politicians. The simple people we talked to, regardless of their country and religion, expressed, first and foremost, their disgust at their politicians and their conviction that foreigners perceive them as barbarians only because of the politicians and the government. Moreover, interethnic conflicts are caused mainly by mystifications and manipulation for political reasons. Dictatorship, ultra-nationalism and religious bigotry have caused the most harm in the entire region.</p>\r\n<p>None of these countries need a Messianic leader to save them. A well-developed infrastructure, lack of visas and free press are the only tools necessary for things to improve.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Petru?</strong><strong> C?linescu: </strong>I had been racking my brains to come up with some sort of conclusion when, eventually, a redeeming quote which I remember only partially popped up: <em>A journey does not need reasons; it proves to be reason enough in itself.</em><em> </em> (Nicholas Bouvier, <em>L\'Usage du monde</em>). Ergo, a journey does not need conclusions either, if I may add my own bit to the quote (Raluca, thanks a bunch for the book). But, if I am to draw a conclusion, it would be that we have to go back. It was like a dip into the sea on an August day: after five minutes out of the water, you want to go back in. We spent too little time in that myriad of places and didn’t see enough. Even so, I returned home with stack of photos which will keep me busy this winter: I will have to sort them out, arrange them and throw some of them. The trip was a team effort and, even if it may sound as a cliché, I would like to thank everyone; I hope I have returned at least half of the help received. <strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p>We would like to thank Alina Miron for having translated the posts into English, professor Lidia Vianu for putting us in touch with the voluntary translators, <a href=\"http://www.badorgood.com/\">badorgood</a> (Ciprian and Gicu) for the blog, The Black Sea Trust for having financed the project, the Azerbaijani mechanic, the godfather of our new hand-made clutch plate, Lucian St?nescu for having translated the application, Raluca Munteanu for having initiated us into the mysteries of Facebook and, last but not least, to everyone who followed us on our journey.</p>\r\n<p>We would also like to thank Dacia and Vodafone for their refusal to provide the logistics for the documentation and for thus keeping the page ad-free.</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p>So...let’s start over!</p>\r\n<p><br class=\"spacer_\" /></p>\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://theblacksea.eu/download/CV_engl_Miron Alina-Olimpia.doc\">Translator: ALINA-OLIMPIA MIRON</a></strong></div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n','','',NULL,NULL),(1083,88,1,'0000-00-00','2009-03-14',NULL,NULL,'Shanghai Couple Massage','<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Lots of people are normally not fully certain what precisely a Shanghai Couples Massage includes.
