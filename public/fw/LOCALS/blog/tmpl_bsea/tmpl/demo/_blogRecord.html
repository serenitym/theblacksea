        The Black Sea - mysterious, menacing and mythical - is at the heart of centuries of warfare, turmoil and historical drama.  A mixture of totalitarian regimes and young democracies, a melting pot of ethnic minorities, the Black Sea region is a point of convergence for three very different civilisations: European, Asian and Middle Eastern.
		<p>Regardless of their nationality or social status, almost all the Black Sea people work for entire years with one dream in their minds: to spend a week at its shores. Its waters, shores and inlands suffered massive transformations as all the surrounding countries tried to tame it, to reshape it, to reinforce or to extract its resources.</p>
		<div class="moreText">
		<p> Petrut Calinescu, born in the Romanian port city of Constanta on the Western shore of the Black Sea, teamed up with a friend and journalist Stefan Candea to circumvent the sea and explore the multitude of cultures and landscapes around it. Their journey took them through Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. Along their way, they passed through a multitude of autonomous republics, some internationally recognised, others stuck in diplomatic limbo: North Karabakh, Abkhazia, Adygea, and Transnistria.
