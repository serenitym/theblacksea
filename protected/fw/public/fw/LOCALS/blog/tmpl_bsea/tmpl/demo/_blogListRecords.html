	    Our 80-day journey has come to an end. We travelled 13.000 kilometres, crossed 11 countries (including the separatist republics) and written 53 posts. Our blog will be taking a break now. We’ll be back with materials from Romania and Bulgaria in autumn when Ioana Hodoiu will take my place as I am heading off on a scholarship. We’ll also write some press materials and we’ll correct the mistakes which had seeped into the on-line journal because of my hurry and ignorance.
	    <p>The comments section was full of flaming opinions regarding the hacking of the Romanian language, triggered by the names of Caucasian towns. It’s funny to see so much surety and passion in those foreign to the region. The correct spelling of a town’s name is highly disputed even by the locals themselves. Only for Sukhumi there are 30 variations in spelling, each similar to a political statement recognizing an interpretation of the town’s history. My objective wasn’t to write a diploma paper on changes in town names, so I decided to transliterate from Russian one of the ways the name is written on the entry plates into town or to use the name on the English map. As regards comments about words ‘which do not exist in Romanian’, I can only say that, fortunately, the Romanian tongue is very dynamic – otherwise, I would have had to express myself via countless combinations of cheese, cabbage, badger and colt.</p>

	    <div class='moreText' id='more1_id_text'>
	        <p> As I have met many journalists in the region, we will try to write several materials together which will be published either here or on the CRJI site.</p>
	        <p>We managed to travel through the countries around the Black Sea without our car being stolen, without falling prey to rakets or without being bamboozled – as we had been warned so often during our trip. However, the most important thing is that not once did we pay anything to the road police, the customs officers or the border guards (except in Transnistria where, out of 10 verifications in a day and a half, we gave in to one and paid a 20-dollar ticket for a fabrication).</p>
	        <p>After returning home, people kept asking me about differences and similarities with Romania. Regarding major differences, at least on the bank of the Black Sea, nowhere else have I found that mixed atmosphere of swindle, disgust, repugnance and arrogance that crawls up on me every time I make the mistake of visiting the Romanian seaside.</p>
	        <p>Another major difference is that, except for Romania and Bulgaria, every country is basically an open wound, bearing the deep marks of recent armed conflicts. Even Turkey in relation to the issue of the Kurds. Colleagues my age studied in improvised schools, in bunkers and have lost friends and family in such conflicts; their parents and grandparents were arrested, deported or executed. The region is similar to the Balkans’ situation of the ‘90s, but at a much larger scale and with conflicts spanning over the past hundred years, with abuses and events of an unthinkable cruelty. The international community has had absolutely no firm reaction whatsoever, much less an efficient strategy to mend things.</p>
	        <p>An important similarity would be the general virulent tone against primitive politicians. The simple folks I talked to, no matter their country or religion, expressed their utter disgust against their own politicians and the belief that foreigners see them as barbaric only because of the latter’s politicians and leaders. Moreover, interethnic conflicts that break out on and off are caused, first and foremost, by mystifications and manipulations for political purposes. Dictatorship, ultra-nationalism and religious zealotry have done the most harm.</p>
	        <p>None of these countries needs a redeeming leader. An excellent infrastructure, no visas and a free media are the only tools necessary for things to improve instantly.</p>

	    <p>I’ve always wondered what the poachers on the Turkish fishing vessels displaying random flags and being summoned with hundreds of gunshots by the Romanian border police look like. Judging by the news in Romania, the scenario is always the same. The Turkish poachers swaggeringly wave the Ukrainian or Romanian flag hoping to pass unnoticed, the Romanian frontier policemen ‘pick up their scent’ and summon them by machine guns until they surrender themselves, but not before throwing overboard most of the game. In the end, everybody goes home, except for the captains who get to be investigated.</p>
	    <div class='moreText' id='more_id_text'>
	        <p>Well, I had the chance to meet them in the little harbour of Kıyıköy where several fishing vessels (exceeding the entire Romanian fleet) kept rocking and I couldn’t help thinking of our fishermen who seem to have descended from the Prehistoric Era with their warped boats as if made from one single tree trunk. The fishing nets lay nicely piled up in the sun, the barracks, where the fish was unloaded, looked spick and span and the fishermen were sipping tea after tea gazing into the distance. There was a sea storm and the weather didn’t seem to improve sooner than three, four days. Cheerful and eager to chat, they pulled their chairs around us and started to ask us about our life, clinging on to their boss, the only speaker of English in the entire harbour.</p>
	        <p>When we mentioned Romania, I was positive their faces would light up and they’d nod their heads in delight: ‘Hagi, Hagi. Lucescu.’ Well, I was about to have the biggest surprise of my life. They started to grin to one another and exchange cheerful glances. Some of them got to their feet and held out their wrists joined together. ‘Virtually everybody here has spent a few days in the Romanian prisons for poaching’, their boss translates and adds that his own brother got some time in the Romanian nick last spring. The time spent there doesn’t seem to have had any traumatizing effect on any of them; actually, judging by their grinning faces and the warm, puckish looks thrown our way (as if to their younger, dumb friends who got screwed over), they see it as a very successful prank. And they did get screwed over, because, while their Bulgarian and Romanian neighbours are fighting at the European Commission for dividing the brill fishing quotas, they poach it like crazy and sell it on the black market in Istanbul for 30-40 Euros/kg.</p>
	        <p>Amidst that morning’s peacefulness and the general giggle, a firm and vigorous ‘cock-a-doodle-doo’ rose above it all, triggering an explosion of exhilaration among the fishermen. Their boss plucked our sleeves and invited us into his floor-tiled office (with a heap of registers on his desk) where an old man was knotting some fishing nets and on a cupboard a white, red-combed rooster reigned. ‘That’s our clock’ he says, at which the fishermen burst out laughing.</p>
